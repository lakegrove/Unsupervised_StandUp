tonight yeah thank you for coming with your white boyfriends i really appreciate it from the bottom of my heart im so excited to be here i have not been performing that much at all in the past two years because two years ago i gave birth to a baby girl and when i first started to come back out to do standup the other standup comics they couldnt believe it they were like oh my god ali what are you doing here didnt you just have a baby i was like listen ive been with my baby girl since she was born all day every day and i love her so much but im on the verge of putting her in the garbage i need to be here to miss her so that i dont go to jail", "its so sexist when people ask me well if youre here then whos taking care of the baby who the fuck do you think is taking care of the baby the tv is taking care of the baby okay the windows are open shes got gummy vitamins on her lap shes fine  ", "i tried being a stayathome mom for eight weeks i like the stayathome part not too crazy about the mom aspect that shit is relentless i was stupid and naive and i thought that being a stayathome mom was about chillaxing getting to shit in your own home watch wendy williams and go out to brunch with your sassy girlfriends i did not understand that the whole price you have to pay for staying at home is that youve gotta be a mom oh and thats a job its a wackass job you get no  no coworkers youre just in solitary confinement all day long with this human tamagotchi that dont got no reset button so the stakes are extremely high a toy tamagotchi is more communicative than a human baby okay because the toy will at least tell you when it poos with a human baby you just have to guess and check your intuition by sniffing its ass twentysix times a day and you cant phone it in and sniff it from afar you really gotta flip the baby over plant your face in the babys ass and give it a good yoga inhale with your mouth and everything because the inside of your nose has been singed from all the poopoo smelling", "i joined a moms group in los angeles yeah i dont find any of these bitches particularly interesting or fun but when youre a new mom on maternity leave its like the walking dead you just gotta hook up with a crew to survive i used to hate on other moms for the clothes that they wore you know these fucking clothes that moms wear all that cheesyass animal print and loud metallic shiny shoes and now i see something thats bedazzled in rhinestones and im like oh that looks nice i think ima get that the more glitter the better because when youre a mom you need sparkle to compensate for the light inside of you that has died", "a lot of young women have anxiety about giving birth well let me tell you something giving birth aint nothing compared to breastfeeding breastfeeding is brutal it is chronic physical torture i thought it was supposed to be this beautiful bonding ceremony where i would feel like i was sitting on a lily pad in a meadow and bunnies would gather at my feet while the fat hawaiian man version of somewhere over the rainbow would play no its not like that at all breastfeeding is this savage ritual that just reminds you that your body is a cafeteria now it dont belong to you no more when my baby girl would get hungry shed yank my nipple back and forth like that bear fucking up leonardo dicaprio in the revenant its frightening i saw that movie and my nipples were like i feel you leo", "i didnt take any classes on breastfeeding because i assumed it was just gonna be this very easy intuitive thing where the baby sucks on your nipple like a straw and the nurse promised me that i would have a particularly easy time since my nipples look like fingers you can spin dvds on them thats how command hooklike they are but apparently you have to get the baby to latch on at a very specific angle you gotta tilt their head and do geometry to get them on properly and its very stressful because when theyre hungry and theyre crying it makes your hormones spray milk all over their face and their neck which then become very slippery and hard to grip and then you gotta slam them on at just the right time and every time i would do it it was like parallel parking i dont know how i did it its a mystery i was never properly trained but i just did it i just went back and forth and back and forth and back and forth until all these very concerned strangers start gathering outside of my car those people who gather outside of asian womens cars while were parking are so helpful and so racist at the same time im always like thank you thank you but fuck you for assuming correctly about me i could not have done this without you", "my mom saw me struggle with breastfeeding and she was very discouraging about it and she was like why are you breastfeeding i raised you on formula and look how shiny your hair is she was like are you falling for that bullshit slogan \u2018breast is best i was like no i do it because breast is free come on mom you know what it is local organic freerange farmtomouth milk squirting outta my titties it was squirting out of like  holes in each titty like the bellagio fountain just woo woo woo woo woo woo woo for free my body was a food factory i wasnt about to let that all go to waste if you shat juicy hamburgers would you ever wait in line at innout again no you would pop a squat over your husbands head every morning and tell him to open wide because breakfast is on the way animal style yeah youd be like i got your secret menu right here ", "i had to stop breastfeeding after eight and a half months i could not take it anymore by the end i felt like the giving tree i used to notunderstand what that depressingass book was about and now i know its about breastfeeding its about a mom who used to have all of these beautiful branches and apples and then this little freeloader comes into her life takes all of her shit and then she just becomes a sadass tree stump with deflated titties people kept on asking me ali how did you get so skinny after the baby she sucked the life outta me as it turns out breastfeeding is not free because you have to buy all of these pillows and pumps to support your breastfeeding and then you might get a clogged duct thats when you get like a traffic jam kidney stone in your titty and then you have to call a lactation consultant a lactation consultant is a white npr listener with dreadlocks named indigo that you have to pay  to rush over to your house and rotorooter your titty indigo had me do pushups dipping my titty in and out of a bowl of scalding hot water and then beat my titty like this in the interim", "this is why women need maternity leave in every other first world country canada france germany women get up to three years off paid maternity leave when they have a new baby in the us we get jack shit in the us there is zero federal policy for maternity leave maternity leave is not just to bond with the baby fuck the baby maternity leave is for new moms to hide and heal their demolishedass bodies i couldnt go back to work topless beating my wet titty trying to establish dominance over all my coworkers youd get

told me about all the crazy shit that comes out of your pussy after you give birth you know what happens after the baby comes out you know what else exits her house her living room her pillows the bob marley poster all the food that went bad in her refrigerator for months so then you have to wear this cartoonishly large pad thats like the size of a toddler mattress and its only held up by the strength of this mesh fishnet underwear thats exclusively available at the hospital you cant get that shit on amazon or anything so you gotta snatch that shit every day its made out of the same material that they package fancy korean pears in its very dac biet okay number one extra large dac biet hospital underwear for three months i was walking around my house with a top knot giant diaper nipples bleeding like a defeated sumo wrestler", "i had a csection yeah which was not the original intention but i was having contractions for  hours yeah and then i was like cut it out the nurse was like keep going i was like bitch i said cut it out \u266a your price is way too high you need to cut it \u266a \u266a cut it cut it you need to cut it\u266a the nurse was not a big hip hop fan so she did not appreciate that or my dave coulier reference look a csection is no joke okay it is major surgery but its very fast they put the anesthesia in your back and then they put up this curtain so that your husband can only see your human side and not your cadaver side and then ten minutes later they hold the baby above the curtain like bloody simba and its over i was like what the fuck did i do all that pushing for when there was this perfectly good emergency exit", "one of my best friends god bless her she was in labor for  hours the babys head kept on going in and out and in and out and in and out and then she still had to have an emergency csection before that shit went down my friend was the kindest most polite dainty lady who would never burp in front of anybody after that shit went down she became the most bitter nasty rawass bitch i have ever met in my life i went to her house to pay her a visit shortly after she opens the door look at my pussy ali look at this shit look

fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b like skittles so my uterus probably looked like a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act like everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich uh mmm they watch property

the time like we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be like ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately ", "i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look like they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be like hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck

yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was like you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i

me out about childbirth by saying ali did you know that youre gonna poop on the table i was like yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it

turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my

being a like an insane alcoholic and thats my thing uh i feel like in most relationships theres like one alcoholic and then like one person whos sad about it and i wanted to be like the fun one so i called my mom um because nothing makes her happier than me being alone and shes like oh my god will i be seeing you more um and im like yes mom and she starts giving me advice shes like am you need to love like youve never been hurt and im like are you reading off of a bumper sticker right now like shes like dance like no ones watching like dance like a couple of people are watching right even if

myself in um good night moon and i i am a good person i swear to you like im very oldschool i think the guy should always pay on the first date for sex and im a romantic im labeled a sex comic like thats in interviews people are always like so you\u2013 you talk about sex and im like i think its just cause im a girl i feel like a guy could get up here and literally pull his dick out and everybody would be like hes a thinker but right its true but then i mention one uti and everyone just thinks i walk around leaving like a snail trail of cum im just like and theyre like oh amys been here", "cum is unsettling isnt it i dont say that to shock you or\u2013 or get your attention\u2013 like oh no she didnt like im just reminding you that were all disgusting no one in here is better than anyone else like youve all caught a hot load you know like if that provides you with discomfort youre just looking at it the wrong way we need to be nicer about cum we really do cum gives us life you know gandhi was cum oprah\u2013 cum oprah could have wound up all over somebodys tits but no we got oprah thank you cum and yes it is sticky and gross and no one ever wants it in their mouth ever ever ever but we need to change how were thinking about it its not a wonderfully regal moment as a woman when you take a load um when someone cums in you youre not like we can do it im glad i leaned in its not\u2013 but its a fact of life all the greatest women have dealt with it okay ruth bader ginsburg diane sawyer michelle obama who i love like the rest of us probably once a week has to carefully walk to the bathroom just squish squish squish squish squish squish squish squish squish squish squish its the white house its probably a long hallway squish squish squish squish squish squish and with her perfect arms she has to deal with it just this is more than normal i wonder whats baracks like get out here i want to talk about those emails shes like im cleaning out your troops right now", "yeah i am labeled a sex comic and i just think that sex is explained incorrectly as far as men and womens roles go its like were all told over and over again men love sex and women just deal with it right like every article every sitcom its always the guy getting home from work like honey how about tonight huh and shes always like blah you know i hate your dick laundry laundry its insane i dont know any girls like that every girl i know likes having sex i love having sex not a weird amount but like a normal person all of my friend\u2013 i mean one of them doesnt but we think something like happened to her but but youre made to feel really disgusting and weird if youre a girl who likes to have sex like ive dated some guy\u2013 i would say  in the relationships i initiate the sex and then  we dont have it um ", "no but ive been in relationships where its always the dude like and then you like later realize he was a sex addict which\u2013 have you ever dated a sex addict its so fun at first when you dont know youre like am i the hottest piece of ass in the world and then youre like oh no he would fuck a mailbox um which is why im dressed like this uh but and then you know ive dated guys where i always have to initiate and thats embarrassing its because i used to fuck really dumb guys and i miss that so very very much dumb guys really pound you cause theyre dumb i love men though i really do i was on the subway the other day and i heard these two guys having this conversation so theres two of them theyre standing on the subway and theyre like hes like dude you gotta go to this bar they give you chips as soon as you sit down and the other guy goes yeah but they dont refill em right hes like they refill em the whole time he goes sick and then they were quiet for like ten stops just kinda like just like basking in the great exchange i just\u2013 i just loved them you know i just looked at them like i want that why cant that be me ", "\u2018cause you know if it had been two girls i would have been looking thinking thats so cool that these two special needs women found each other you know if it had been me and a girlfriend and i was like they give you chips they give you\u2013 youd be like oh my god wheres their stop like dont they have an attendant youd be worried but i like creative types i fucked up i got to an age i want to be able to have a conversation with someone like an idiot and the creative types theyre all ugh like comics and artists they all\u2013 you have to treat their dick like a souffl\u00e9 in the oven you cant make a big motion or loud noise near it or itll fall and you have to start over with a good attitude is that how you jerk someone off am i doing it its crazy like we\u2013 its crazy that we get\u2013 we get guilted about this", "like women wanna cum of course we wanna cum what girls are having sex like oh no im just\u2013 im just honored to be witnessing your process i\u2013 its just so cool to be a part of\u2013 no i dont want to feel the one good thing were allowed as humans no i\u2013 this is just you please anywhere um make your girls cum guys its just explained incorrectly its just i remember as a very young girl too young it was broken down for me it was like be careful amy men only want one thing they are all gonna try and fuck you i was like okay and then i waited lets see am i on the wrong street are they i do like talking about sex i like hearing about it more like i love hearing sex acts you know theres like terms for all those\u2013 all that stuff like theres a the donkey punch you know or like the dirty sanchez ", "these are the ones\u2013 the classics that we all grew up with right those are like the to kill a mockingbird of sex terms but there are so many that youve never heard of i love hearing new ones theres like theres the dirty rochester did you ever hear of that okay that is where the guy shits on your chest while hes on a business trip to rochester is that maybe not really a thing and i was perhaps lied to i love\u2013 there\u2013 theres the dolphin thats where the guy tries to put it in the girls butt and she goes ehhehh ehhehh thats like a fun family one theres the alaskan pipeline which um a guy shits in a condom freezes it and then you know what i wont say the end of it cause it doesnt end like in a super romantic like notebooky type way", "she doesnt like pull it out and find a ring on it and say like yes theres no good one for the girl theres no like wacky shirley where she sits on his face and reads her tweets like theres nothing we have nothing does anyone know one thats good for the girl anybody no right i asked that\u2013 i asked that in the first show and somebody said the minivan two in the front five

like the defensive line for the bears are in the wedding", "i really respect you guys for coming out because if you follow me on instagram youre probably like is this bitch in the hospital is she gonna be there yeah i made it i ive been hospitalized a couple of times since ive been pregnant with hyperemesis and the very first time was about a month ago and i was throwing up for about five hours when i was taken to the hospital the doctor came in and he explained to me and my sister and my husband who were are all in the room he said youre going to be here for at least five hours getting liquids and without skipping a beat my husband said to my sister okay cool because i saw a place where you can paint pottery nearby you guys are like is he gay so my sister didnt even like check in with me if it was cool that they left me as soon as he said pottery they just left and i was like ill be here and about an hour and a half later my sister rushed back in the room and she said okay listen be nice to him about what he painted ", "im like okay shes like im serious he worked really hard on it okay she goes and its not very flattering im like what but my husbands brain is a little different \u2018cause you go to these places you usually paint a teddy bear or a jewelry box you know but my husband decided to to paint a plate which he would use as a canvas to paint me and im going to show you the picture i think its important for you guys to see the picture um and i want to show you this and i want you to know that there were no qualifiers before he showed me this picture he was sure it was pretty good this is the picture that he painted i was in the hospital guys what is i wanted to go whats with my chin on my neck i look like trump like i look i couldnt say any of this to him okay get rid of it people are leaving this is upsetting this is an upsetting image i mean i had to comfort him", "my husband is a really great sport you know he really is i keep messing with him like you know ive had a tough pregnancy so the other day i was like babe this is kind of too hard for me i dont think i can do it and hes like what do you mean and i was like what do you think i mean i think i i need to get an abortion and this was his response he went really i was like no what im going to announce it on instagram and then im going to be like actually forget it i dont like it im tired i dont like it thank god that was his response you know what if hed been like cool ill warm up the car", "i knew from the beginning that my husbands brain was a little different than mine um and about i have to start this over cause i really want to get this right because i love him very much and my husband was diagnosed with what used to be called aspergers he has autism spectrum disorder hes on the spectrum and there were some signs early on like we went for a walk about a year ago and i fell and kinda nine out of ten people would go oh my god are you okay right maybe more like ten out of ten people oh my god are you okay but instead my husband went he kind of froze and became a lighthouse opening and closing his mouth just and i remember lying on the ground looking up at him and i wasnt mad i just thought huh a lot of huh moments you know and once he was diagnosed it dawned on me how funny it was because all of the characteristics that make it clear that hes on the spectrum are all of the reasons that i fell madly in love with him thats the truth he says whatever is on his mind he keeps it so real you know he doesnt care about social norms or what you expect him to say or do you know if i say to him like does this look like shit hell go yeah you have a lot of other clothes why dont you wear those im like okay", "but he can also make me feel more beautiful than anyone ever has my whole life yeah its true and he cant lie is that the dream man a guy who cant lie but that also means that he cant lie for me which is an essential part of any relationship were friends with this couple and they broke up and the guy started dating a new girl pretty soon after and we happened to be at the party where they got together so i didnt rush to tell the exgirlfriend what happened so a couple of months later we had dinner with her and she was like and you know at that party thats when they got together and i was like no its not possible and chris goes no you remember no no i dont yeah remember \u2018cause you said \u2018oh my god hes leaving with her thank you chris thank you i guess i forgot about that", "also one of the the signs of autism is you dont make sort of the appropriate facial expression for the occasion youre at so we were gonna go on a red carpet together for the first time and we were practicing his smiles you know and we didnt land on one that we were in love with so we were out of time so i said just this is what i do just think about something you love you know and he loves the ocean so so we went out there and it worked but it worked too well \u2018cause in all the pictures im doing my normal bullshit and he was like i noticed i was like a pond just like youre glancing at a pond pull it back", "its exciting being pregnant its not all bad the best part about it is not getting your period yeah thats the silver uterine lining if you want to look for one thats nice because you know what i realized right before i got pregnant i noticed how ashamed weve all been made to feel about getting our period our whole lives like we choose it you know like cant kick my bleeding habit you know i just want it i want to do it its supposed to be you know a secret the second you get it your mom goes youre a woman now and thats disgusting never let anyone know of your filthy secret and youre like okay im  im ready to handle this this is my rainbow brite lunch box \u266a rainbow brite stars are shining bright \u266a and it is thats the most embarrassing thing that could possibly happen to you as a kid that someone knows you have your period or they see you have your period at that age for men the most embarrassing thing is unwanted erections right but then they grow up and show them to everyone maybe thats what we should do i dont know call a coworker into your office carl psst come in here close the door carl youre getting very sleepy all this talk about dick pics how about a tamp pic you up", "if youre still in a position where youre getting dick pics ladies i have a suggestion for you when you get a dick pic send back a dick pic you go oh im sorry i thought we were exchanging our favorite dick pics dick for dick pic for pic no i thought", "why are we made to feel so ashamed of a natural bodily function that ultimately brings life you know its like if you forget a tampon you have to bum one from somebody what we all do is first you look around like youre going to say something racist just like and whatever race you thought i meant thats your problem and then you kind of lean in and we dont even say the whole sentence we kind of go does anybody have a tampon what is this whats the claw thats how disgusted we are with ourselves does anyone have a tampon and i notice myself do it i was in a gym locker room thank you and and there were a bunch of women in there and i and this woman across the locker room with so much confidence was like oh yeah i do what size and like obviously i know there are different sizes of tampons but ive never been confronted with that question before you know shes like yeah whats the circumference of your pussy hole grande or venti what are we plugging bitch ive got pilates what is it then all the other women in the locker room kinda lean in to hear my answer you know im just like i dont know do you have like a super grand canyon i dont

exciting than the divacup its a new invention called thinx yes yeah you dont need a tampon theyre just these underwear that you just bleed into which i guess makes me a fucking inventor ah who knew should i go on shark tank sharks", "did anyone have a mom like me who didnt really trust tampons and made them only wear a pad right and millennials if you dont know what a pad is congratulations and

out there no i love the kardashians the kardashians are so confident they confuse me about my own confidence so before i was pregnant i was kind of like feeling myself one day and i bought lingerie like the real shit like the you know fishnets and then like the pulley system here you know thought they wouldve updated that technology but its still a pulley system and then you know the boost whatever its called and you know i went i paid for it i tried it on at home you know where i could take my own life and in the safety of home and i tried it on and i was kind of ready to blow my own mind i kind of sidled up to the mirror and i check myself out and i was like oh this isnt for everybody hmm okay i looked like i should have been on law  order like he went that way my fishnets looked like theyd caught an actual fish", "it was it was pretty confusing its tough to say confident as a girl i dont know what im having i hope its a girl um but really just because its such a scary time for men such a scary time men thank you so much for leaving your houses tonight i just god first responders just so brave i dont know if men know how scared we are as women all the time like one in three of us will be assaulted at some point in our lives if youre a woman of color its even more than that if youre a trans woman forget it at night in new york if i take the subway at night i will run home women we run home not for the cardio its true when you walk to your car in a dark parking lot what do you ladies do we do the little makeshift brass knuckle with our key right i dont know what our plan is with that key in our knuckle oh no you dont ahh not on my watch boopboop i mean", "there was a study done and it said that women mostly fear violence thats our number one fear and the same study showed that mens number one fear was ridicule oh yeah god im so sorry i didnt know you guys were going through that it must be so hard for you do you guys run home because youre afraid of somebody telling a little jokey about you i think that we need to start from scratch you know im so grateful to this new generation of women that came along and theyre like hey have you been getting sexually harassed like this your whole lives and were like oh yeah and theyre like yeah you wanna do something about that and were like oh yeah thats a very good idea theyre like yeah and were like oh were so used to it you know youre at work and youre like i have to make every guy think that we also might fuck and do a good job its not fair", "its not fair to men either you guys are raised with so much pressure to be so masculine at such a young age its bullshit it sucks its like a sixyearold kid crying stop crying you little pussy we toughen them up at a young age so they dont get made fun of and then as little girls youre in school with these boys and when a little boy is mean to you or he teases you what does everybody say \u2013 he likes you \u2013 he likes you ooh youre like he knocked my books out of my hands whoo looks like somebody has a little boyfriend at school thats a good thing and youre like oh thats a good thing okay im the luckiest girl in school he pushed me down the stairs youre going to prom prom right then we grow up and we all have friends who were like why do i only date assholes \u2018cause youve been trained to do that since you were a toddler you know we

down i was really nervous about getting arrested ive been arrested before obviously but but i was obsessed with the fear of being hungry you know while i was locked up so it probably would have been like that before i was pregnant but that just doubled it so the whole way down and you know we get down there and it was really intense and really emotional and we were gonna get arrested on the capitol steps but they barricaded those so we all rush into the hart building where the senators offices are and we all flood in this hallway and you know the banners are flying and the capitol police are closing in and we know were about to be arrested and everyones chanting no justice no peace and we believe survivors we believe survivors and i know were about to be arrested so i am ramming

opinion thats fucking i was trying to signal her you know hey do you think its safe for us to have sex do you think it would probably kill the baby and we shouldnt do it shes like no its safe the whole time i was like okay okay do you want me to come to your house to tell your husband he can fuck you \u2018cause people tell you youre like wow that was fast last time we saw you you were single

confuse my body into making a new hole but most guys can figure it out but you really realize that they dont understand where our hole goes when theyre behind you right \u2018cause during some sex its always i dont know whose suggestion to not look at your face anymore how about you turn around oh okay you look back over the shoulder theyre like nope youre like okay ill be here thats when you know
