At the end of preliminary tokenization and cleaning I took a look at men (blue) vs female (red) comics and the word differences between the two.

One thing off the bat is it's clear I will need to strip out kevin, dave, ellen, amy and some of the comics self referential names.  I also need to look at taking out more parts of speech I missed in my initial cleaning including words like "um" and "oh" 

In terms of diffences between the two we can see that women tend to talk more about pregnancy, therapy, body issues (weight, period, body) and husbands.  Men seem to have more words around police, jail, drugs, smoking, Michael Jackson and R Kelly.
