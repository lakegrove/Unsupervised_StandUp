# Unsupervised Stand Up

## Using Natural Language Processing to perform Topic Modeling on Mainstream Stand Up Comedy From the Last 40 Years

## Context and Goal

The development of Artificial Intelligence has improved or increase the efficiency many aspects of our lives.  One frontier that it has yet to contribute heavily to is comedy.  Comedy is complicated genre full of subtlety, sarcasm and reflections of our culture of the time.  And while I don't expect to generate a full stand up special from machine learning (not yet at least), I am curious what the great comedians do on a deeper level.

This is a passion project to look at some of my favorite comedians to see what has made them so special.  What topics do they discuss? How has that changed across time for a specific comedian? What do similar comedians of a similar time discuss? And who am I kidding, I get to laugh as I do my research. 

In learning more about these questions and others, I hope to understand how far the discourse has come and where the latest cutting edge of comedy is in the age of being cautious in the face of being cancelled by social media culture. 

I plan to focus most closely on my favorite comedy Dave Chappelle

## Methodologies

I used natural language processing and unsupervised learning as an approach to learning more about comedy. 

Workflow:

- Gather documents (HTML)
- Strip text from documents
