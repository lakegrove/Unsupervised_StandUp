    "Using NLP let's explore modern comedy and the topics they cover.  Comedy is an outlet that on the surface level is to entertain and make us laugh when at its best.  On a deeper level, it explores the topics and ideas that we don't always say outloud and explore different aspects of our culture.  I think it's an interesting problem for NLP given the layers within comedy including sarcasm, symbolism and metaphorical stories. \n",

      "you understand im scared as shit i mean come on the car smells like weed he was speeding this man is fucking drunk im scared chip was not scared at all it was weird he didnt even turn his radio down isnt that weird a little bit i mean you get pulled over wouldnt you turn your radio down nobody wants to get their ass beat for a soundtrack and shit you know what im saying chip in the music blasting were not gonna take it earlier today just relax close your butt cheeks relax let me do the talking you wanna know what he said this is almost exactly what he said i couldnt believe it he says sorry officer i i didnt know i couldnt do that i was fucking shocked the cop said well now you know get outta here get the fuck outta here chip said okay i will sir thank you what whats wrong with you dave i didnt know i couldnt do that he said that was good wasnt it because i didnt know i couldnt do that im shocked i wasnt shocked at the audacity i was just shocked because i wouldve never thought to say that i dont think anybody i knew would think to say that because they know we know the law\n",

      "now this is when i knew i was in a bad neighborhood you only see this in the worst neighborhoods remember its  in the morning its  in the morning i look out the window there was a fucking baby standing on a corner for real and the baby the baby didnt even look scared it was just standing there i mean it made me sad it made me sad really cause you know what i mean cause i wanted to help the baby i was like mmmmm i dont trust you either im sorry click click the old baby on the corner trick eh not gonna fall for that shit so wheres this limousine driver you know i start feeling bad as time goes by i start feeling worse like man what is wrong with me what the hell is wrong i am scared of a baby you know this baby could be in trouble he might need my help i gotta do something \n",
      "but i wasnt gonna get out the car im serious man i just cracked the window a little bit it was an old limousine i could roll it down and shit hey baby baby go home man its  in the morning what the fuck are you doing up the baby said im selling weed nigga i said ohhh shit i wasnt expecting that im serious i had to buy two bags from him to calm my nerves let me get two let me get two times got back in the car and rolled me a joint that shit was scary man every once in a while like a crackhead would come up to the car and look in the window it was like jurassic park and shit hed be looking around the car all right get outta here cracky that baby was still standing there man i was like what the  then i started feeling bad again you know how weed make you feel guilty sometimes you be like man what is wrong with me man i have just bought weed from an infant i cant condone this kind of behavior what am i thinking i cant let the fear ruin my morals gotta do something hey baby stop selling weed you got your whole life ahead of you he said fuck you nigga i got kids to feed i was like god damn\n",
      "sad now just at that very moment one of the crackheads was running across the street and got hit by a car now i know it was a hitandrun the police did it thats all right they sprinkled some crack on him and he got back up ill be seeing that kind of shit man its what it is they use the tv to program us from a young age you ever watch like a cartoon that you used to watch when you were little as an adult that shit is wild shit some wild shit i mean i was with my nephew were sitting there were watching pepé le pew and i say to my nephew i said now pay attention to this guy cause hes funny i used to watch him when i was little and were watching pepé le pew and im old now and im like good god what kind of fucking racist is this guy like take it easy pepé my nephew was sitting there cracking up hehehe see sometimes you gotta take the pussy like pepé youre like no nooo i had to turn the channel real quick\n",
