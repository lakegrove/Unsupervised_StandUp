2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,1,"Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. All right. No really. Boy. Well, it's good to come home, boy. I swear. I know, man. It's been a while. It's been a while. Hey. DC is different. I've been gone, man. It took me years to be able to do the show. Boy, DC has changed. It's different now. There's a lot of white people walking around, isn't there? I mean I left DC in the 80s. It was not like this in the 80s. When crack was going on. Remember when crack was going on? White people would be looking at DC from Virginia with binoculars. Boy, that looks dangerous. Not yet. New white people. You can't scare these white people. I tried. You roll up on 'em: BOO! What the hell is wrong with you? Those days are over. I'm glad that were doing a show here by Howard, you know. You see like white people come out. And that's good.

2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,2,"One thing I'm seeing. Ever be walking down the street. And you see like a group of black dudes walking. Not just any black dudes. We're talking, you know, thugs. Talking, you know. They'll be some thugs, man. And in the group, in the group they got like one or two or sometimes as many as three white guys. Ever see this shit? Let me tell you something about those white guys. Those white guys are the most dangerous motherfuckers in that group. It's true. It's true, man. Ain't no telling what they done to get those black dudes' respect. But those black dudes have seen them do some wild shit. I'll tell you that. I've been trying to tell brothers that. Every group of brothers should have at least one white guy in it. I'm serious. For safety. Because when ship goes down.. Somebody's gonna need to talk to the police. I mean that's when that... That's when that white friend comes in handy. Uh-oh. Ernie, wanna get this one for me. Come on now. Come on now. Do something."
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,3,"The black people are very afraid of the police. That's a big part of our culture. No matter how rich you are. No matter how old you are. We're just afraid of them. We got every reason to be afraid of them. You know what I mean. You're a white lady. You ever been pulled over before? What do they say? Let me see your drivers license and your registration, right? See? See I'm just guessing. That's not what they say to us. You wouldn't believe what they say to us. Spread your cheeks and lick your sack! Like what the heck? Excuse me? You heard me. Spread open your cheeks and lift your sack. I got a driver's license too. It's an easier way to prove who I am, isn't it? What does that prove? I can't go to the bank like that cash my check. What you mean, I don't have my ID. Wait a minute. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Chappelle. Right this way. Why didn't you spread your cheeks when you came in here? Scared of them. I'm serious, man. There will be a red light. The police might pull up next to you. It won't be no big deal for you. But I'm fucking fall apart hard. Don't look over there. No no no."
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,4,"But I didn't always know. It was a black thing. It took me a while to figure that out. I learned that shit when I was in New York. I was in New York City. Now I was hanging out with a friend of mine. He was a white guy. We was hanging out. We were lost in the city. You know, smoke a joint. I don't know if it was a coincidence. We were lost and high and shit. My white buddy, he was smoking a joint. Dave. Dave! It's the God damned cops. I'm gonna ask them for directions I said Chip, no! Chip, don't do it! It was too late. He was walking over there. This man was high as shit. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me!!! I need some information. He starts confessing things he shouldn't confess. I'm a little high. All I wanna know... which way is 3rd Street? The cop is like, hey, take it easy. You're on Third Street. You better be careful. Go ahead. Move it. Move it. That's all that happened. It's the end of the story. Now I know that's not amazing to some of you. But you ask one of these black fellows, that shit is fucking incredible, isn't it?"
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,5,"A black man would never dream of talking to the police high. That's a waste of weed. Serious. I'm scared to talk to the police when I'm sleepy. Fuck around and get the wrong idea or something. Oo-oh! Oh my God! That nigga was on PCP, Johnson. I had to use necessary force. You saw him. No, no paperwork. Just sprinkle some crack on him. Let's get out of here. That's how it is. But at the time I didn't think there was anything racial about it. I was like, man, Chip. You got fucking lucky. You better be careful."
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,6,"But then another time, me and Chip were driving. No I'm not driving. Chip is driving. And he's driving a little crazy. He's been drinking. I don't like to let my friends drive drunk. But you know I was smoking a joint. I couldn't really say shit to the guy. Now we get to a red light. We stop at a red light. And a cop pulls up next to us. And I'll never forget it. Chip looks at me and goes. He's all drunk and he's like ""Dave..."" I'm going to race him. I knew it was a bad idea. But I was high. I tried to explain to him that it was a bad idea. But all that came out was... Well, maybe sometimes we gotta race? All right! Man, that light turned green. And Chip took off. Zig-zagging and shit so no one could pass him. The other car didn't know it was racing. Then the police seen us. And pulled us over. "
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,7,"You understand I'm scared as shit. I mean, come on. The car smells like weed. He was speeding. This man is fucking drunk. I'm scared. Chip was not scared at all. It was weird. He didn't even turn his radio down. Isn't that weird, a little bit? I mean you get pulled over, wouldn't you turn your radio down? Nobody wants to get their ass beat for a soundtrack and shit. You know what I'm saying? Chip in the music blasting. We're not gonna take it. Earlier today, just relax. Close your butt cheeks. Relax. Let me do the talking. You wanna know what he said? This is almost exactly what he said. I couldn't believe it. He says. ""Sorry, officer, I... I didn't know I couldn't do that."" I was fucking shocked! The cop said, well now you know. Get outta here. Get the fuck outta here. Chip said, okay. ""I will, sir. Thank you. What? What's wrong with you, Dave? I didn't know I couldn't do that."" He said, ""that was good, wasn't it? Because I didn't know I couldn't do that."" I'm shocked. I wasn't shocked at the audacity. I was just shocked because I would've never thought to say that. I don't think anybody I knew would think to say that because they know we know the law."
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,8,"Every black dude in this room is a qualified paralegal and shit. He knows the law. If one of us even start to do something wrong, an old black man would pop out of nowhere. nigga, don't do that. That's 5 to 10. Watch out. We know the laws and the penalties. Chip didn't even know he couldn't race. I'm not saying I don't like police. I'm not saying that. I'm saying I'm just scared of them. Nothing wrong with that. Sometimes we want to call them too. Somebody broke into my house once. This is a good time to call him. But I went, I don't know. The house is too nice. It ain't a real nice house but they'll never believe I live in it. They'd be, he's still here! Oh my God. Open and shut case. Johnson. I saw this once before when I was a rookie. Apparently this nigga broke in and hung up pictures of his family everywhere. Well, let's sprinkle some crack on him and get out of here."
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,9,"That's that whole brutality thing. That's common knowledge, man. There was a time when only minorities knew about that. I won't say whites wouldn't believe us. But they were a little skeptical. A little skeptical. I mean I don't blame you. Even Newsweek printed it. It was in Newsweek. White people were like, oh my God! Honey, did you see this? Apparently the police have been beating up negroes like hot cakes. It's in the May issue. I mean really how could you know about that? How could anyone else know? You know. Maybe he should have seen something a little suspicious. Doesn't that seem a little suspicious? Every dead black person in a police van has crack sprinkled on them? Come on, man. Come on, man. Who get shot and sprinkles crack on themselves? Nobody would do that. BAM! Oww! Oww!"
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,10,"I don't want to leave no mysteries. I'm a paranoid guy, you know. I'm afraid to call 911 for anything. If it's like a fire or anything. Because they tape those phone calls. I see the shows. They tape them. And then they play on television. That's fucked up. Now I'll say anything if I'm scared. That shit is private. You're on your own. What if I get killed? They start playing that 911 tape on the news. I'm dead. I can't explain myself to my buddies. We was watching the news. We have Reg Chapman on the scene. Reg? What's going on out there? It always takes the guy on the scene a minute. Hi, Bob! Hi yes. We just got hold of a copy of Dave Chappelle's frantic 911 emergency call. Remember, viewers, some of this language is disturbing. ""Hello. Emergency?"" ""Help!"" ""Help, motherfucker! They're coming to get me!"" ""Just calm down, sir. Where are ya?"" ""Oh, oh, I shit on myself."" ""I can't stop cryin'."" T"
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,11,"hey play that shit 30, 40 times a day. All my buddies will be at my funeral looking at me. ""You know Dave shit on himself, right?"" I saw it on the news. ""Died crying like a bitch"" I'll be dead, I can't even defend myself. That's not a nice thing to do. That's not a nice thing to do. I mean, it's a 9-1-1 tape. How do they expect you to sound? Of course you gon' be scared. It's an emergency. There's nobody calls 9-1-1 cool and relaxed. Now that shit would sound ridiculous, wouldn't it? ""Hello, emergency."" ""Hi!"" Hey, 9-1-1. how are ya? Yeah, uh, look, there's a group of hooded white men gathering outside of my house. And it looks like they mean business. ""GET OUT HERE nigga!"" ""I gotta go."" ""You guys try and hurry."""
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,12,"Too much pressure. That's my problem: I can't... I can't handle pressure. Sometimes pressure makes me talk different. I'm serious. Have you ever had that social pressure... have you ever talk to someone who's fake? And they make you fake? Like, that guy would be like: ""Hey, how ya doin'?"" And you're like: ""Fine, how are you?"" I don't even talk like that. I get sick of that shit. I do it and it just makes me sick. Sometimes I'll talk crazy just to make myself feel better. Do y'all do that? You start talking like crazy. You ever hear this voice? ""MAH."" That's how bad guys used to talk in the 40's, in the old days. See, I used... I talk like that. Not all the time, but if somebody put the pressure on me, fuck it. I gotta cut loose. When the police pull me over I'll talk like crazy. ""Son? Son. Do you know why we pulled you over?"" ""Nyah. Cause I'm black, see! That's right. MAAAH!"" I do it. It's not illegal to talk like that. How do they know I don't talk like that every day? ""Stop talking like that."" ""Stop talking like what, copper? Mah. That's how I talk, see."""
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,13,"You gotta make life interesting like that cause the shit is flimsy. Life is flimsy. You... you think you're gonna live, but ain't nobody gon' live forever. It's dangerous out here. We know what's going on. I travel now, you know. I used to think that D.C. had the roughest ghettos in the country. Nah, nigga. Mm-mmm. I have seen some shit now. Oh, there's some rough, rough areas outside of D.C. Yeah, everybody should go to the ghetto. I was taken to the ghetto one time. That's the worst: When you get taken and you're not expecting to go. You know, usually you wanna know when you're going to the ghetto, like, ""I'm gonna see some wild shit."" I gotta prepare myself. ""I'm gonna see somethin' crazy."" "
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,14,"When you're taken, it's different. I had a limousine driver. It was after a show, it was late at night, it was like 3:00 in the morning. I had a limousine driver, he was a nice guy, talking to me and shit. ""Oh, hey, where you from, dawg?"" D.C.? Word? ""That's a rough city, man."" Then his cell phone started ringing. ""Hold on one second."" Hello? Oh, what's up, nigga? What? What the fuck? Slow down. What? What the FUCK?! No! No! Noooo! Fuck that! nigga, FUCK IT! I'm on my way! Hey. Hey. ""I gotta make a stop real quick."" At 3:00 in the morning... I didn't know he was taking me to the ghetto at first. I started looking out the window, I was like, ""What the fuck?"" There was a gun store, gun store, liquor store, gun store. ""Where the fuck you takin' me?!"" "
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,15,"""This don't look good."" He didn't say shit. He just pulled up in front of an old, rickety building. That looked like a project. Now, I never been there before, I'm not sure if it was a project. But it certainly had all the familiar symptoms of a project. A fucking crackhead ran this way. And then another one jumped out a tree and shit. The driver said, ""I'll be right back,"" and left me. Took the keys with him, he just left me. At 3:00 in the morning, in front of a project, in a fucking limousine. This was not good. I was like, ""Man, I gotta look around and see if I"" can see some landmarks and figure out where I'm at. I have to escape on foot."
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,16,"Now this is when I knew I was in a bad neighborhood. You only see this in the worst neighborhoods. Remember, it's 3:00 in the morning. It's 3:00 in the morning. I look out the window... There was a fucking baby standing on a corner. For real. And the baby... the baby didn't even look scared. It was just standing there. I mean, it made me sad. It made me sad, really, cause... You know what I mean? Cause I wanted to help the baby. I was like, ""Mm-mmm, I don't trust you either. I'm sorry."" Click. CLICK! The old baby on the corner trick, eh? Not gonna fall for that shit. So where's this limousine driver? You know, I start feeling bad. As time goes by, I start feeling worse. Like, ""Man, what is wrong with me? What the hell is wrong?"" I am scared of a baby. You know, this baby could be in trouble. He might need my help. I gotta do something. "
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,17,"But I wasn't gonna get out the car. I'm serious, man. I just cracked the window a little bit. It was an old limousine. I could roll it down and shit. ""Hey, baby!"" Baby, go home, man. It's 3:00 in the morning. What the FUCK are you doing up?! The baby said, ""I'm selling weed, nigga!"" I said, ""Ohhh shit."" I wasn't expecting that. I'm serious. I had to buy two bags from him to calm my nerves. ""Let me get two. Let me get two times."" Got back in the car and rolled me a joint. That shit was scary, man. Every once in a while, like, a crackhead would come up to the car and look in the window. It was like Jurassic Park and shit. He'd be looking around the car... ""All right. Get outta here, cracky."" That baby was still standing there, man. I was like, ""What the... "". Then I started feeling bad again. You know how weed make you feel guilty sometimes. You be like... ""Man, what is wrong with me, man?"" I have just bought weed from an infant. I can't condone this kind of behavior. What am I thinking? I can't let the fear ruin my morals. ""Gotta do something."" ""Hey baby."" Stop selling weed. ""You got your whole life ahead of you."" He said, ""FUCK you, nigga! I got kids to feed."" I was like, ""God DAMN."""
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,18,"Sad. Now just at that very moment, one of the crackheads was running across the street and got hit by a car. Now I know it was a hit-and-run: The police did it. That's all right. They sprinkled some crack on him and he got back up. I'll be seeing that kind of shit, man? It's what it is. They use the TV to program us, from a young age. You ever watch, like, a cartoon that you used to watch when you were little as an adult? That shit is wild shit.. Some wild shit. I mean, I was with my nephew. We're sitting there, we're watching Pepé Le Pew. And I say to my nephew, I said ""Now pay attention to this guy cause he's funny."" I used to watch him when I was little."" And we're watching Pepé Le Pew and I'm old now. And I'm like ""Good God..."" what kind of fucking racist is this guy? Like ""take it easy, Pepé."" My nephew was sitting there cracking up: ""Hehehe."" See? Sometimes you gotta take the pussy like Pepé. You're like ""No!"" Nooo! I had to turn the channel real quick."
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,19,"I turn on Sesame Street and I say (phew) ""Sesame Street."" This is much better cause now he'll learn how to count and spell."" But now I'm watching it as an adult and I realize Sesame Street teaches kids other things: It teaches kids how to judge people and label people. That's right. They got a character on there named Oscar... and treat this guy like shit the entire show. They judge him right in his face. ""Oscar, you are so mean. Isn't he, kids?"" ""Yeah, Oscar. You're a grouch."" He's like, ""BITCH, I live in a FUCKING trash can!"" I'm the poorest motherfucker on Sesame Street! ""Nobody's helping me."" Then you wonder why the kids roll up and step over homeless people. ""Get it together, Grouch."" ""Get a job, Grouch."""
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,20,"So don't even tell me how to get to Sesame Street. It's a terrible place. I wouldn't go there if I knew the way. Who would wanna live in a neighborhood like that? Fucking six-foot pigeons walking around and... and elephant that's a junkie. ""HI, BIRD."" Yeah, that's right. Snuffy! ""HI, BIRD. I'm sick. I need some smack, BIRD."" The Cookie Monster with his eyes popping out of his head, screaming: ""Cookie cookie cookie!"" You're like, ""Ergh!"" What kind of cookies are you talking about? ""Chocolate chips don't do that to people."" And they had the nerve to put a pimp on there. They didn't come out and say he was a pimp, but I know a pimp when I see one. They called him The Count. Had a cape and everything. You'd have seen him pimping. ""Bitch, where is my money?"" You've been late four times. I've been counting. How many times must I smack you before you act right? One! Two! TWO SMACKS! ""Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, ah, ahhhh..."""

You know, the more you know, the more you don't know and shit. You know. Like a lot of people are telling me, ""Dave, you know, you just gotta relax. That racism thing has been bugging you too much."" I'll be thinking about it. Sometimes shit will happen. You know. A lot of black people will relate to this. Have you ever had something happen that was so racist that you didn't even get mad? It's like, ""Goddamn. That was rac... that was racist."" I mean it was so blatant, you were just like ""Wow!"" Like you were almost like, it didn't even happen to you. It was like a fucking movie. That was like you were just watching Mississippi Burning: ""Wooow."" "
2000,Killin' Them Softly,Dave Chappelle,Washington D.C.,M,8.8,9,9029,8.5,8.8,484,6434,22,"That happened to me. I was in Mississippi. I was in Mississippi doing a show. And I go to the restaurant to order some food. And, I say to the guy... I say: ""I would like to have..."" And before I even my sentence, he says: ""The CHICKEN."" I was like, ""What the... fuck."" I could not believe it. I could not believe that shit. This man was absolutely right. I said, ""How did he know..."" that I was going to get some chicken?"" I asked him. I said, ""How did you know that?"" How did you know I was going to get some chicken?"" He looked at me like I was crazy. He said, ""Come on, buddy. COME ON, BUDDY."" Now everybody knew that as soon as you walked through the goddamn door... you were gonna get some chicken. It ain't no secret down here ""that blacks and chickens are quite fond of one another."" And then I finally understood what he was saying, and I got upset. I wasn't even mad. I was just upset. I wasn't ready to hear that shit. All these years, I thought I liked chicken because it was delicious. Turns out I'm genetically predisposed to liking chicken. That shit is whack. I got no say in the matter. That guy ruined chicken for me. I'm scared to eat it in public. I don't want someone to see me and say something. You know what I mean? You'll be eating some chicken: (CRUNCH) (crunch) (crunch-crunch) ""Look at him."" He loves it. Just like it said in the encyclopedia. ""Look how happy he looks."""

I'll be like, ""Alright. You too, man. Peace."" ""Uh... all right now. Bye-bye."" They don't know what to say, right? So sometimes I'll make up shit that's not even slang.

We fought in the Civil War. We damn near freed ourselves. Then, with Reconstruction, black people did great. My great-grandfather was a very wealthy man.

Yet, we still fought. And Dr. King was born. And then, things got better. Twenty years after Dr. King was assassinated, Michael Jackson was moonwalking on television. Something, something, something.

This wouldn't have gone this far if some women weren't willing to do it. You can't ask every woman to hold the line. Some women can carry things heavier than others. So we should fight for one another. We should forgive the ones of us that are weaker and support the ones of us that are stronger. And then we can beat the thing. If you guys keep going after individuals, the system is going to stay intact. You have to have men on your side. And I'm telling you right now, you're gonna have a lot of imperfect allies."
2017,The Bird Revelation,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,7.9,8,8500,7.9,7.9,591,5631,28,"I'll tell you what happened, but I can't say it directly. There's a book to me that encapsulates my entire experience. Before I left the show. And the book is called Pimp. It's written by a guy named Iceberg Slim. Yeah, bring it up here. This is Matthew. Matthew's from France. He's white. And yet, he has an original copy of this book written by a black American who was a pimp in the '40s. Iceberg Slim. His real name was Robert Beck. He got the name Iceberg because he was in a bar in Chicago, and there was a shootout in the bar, and a bullet went through this nigga's hat, and he still finished his drink. Pimps love shit like that. They said, ""Man, you're ice cold."" And he said, ""I like that."" And it stuck."
2017,The Bird Revelation,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,7.9,8,8500,7.9,7.9,591,5631,29,"This book is so heavy in the front and has a glossary of pimp terms, because the ideas are so foreign to the American ears. For instance, do you know what the phrase ""mileage on a ho"" means? Of course you don't. Mileage on a ho is a very wild concept. It means that pimps understand there's a finite amount of bad shit a person can do before they lose their fucking mind. And a good pimp can look at a woman that he's never seen before and call it. She's good for 500 fucks. That's her mileage. Anything over that, that bitch is gonna spill. They do it to you. Why the fuck you think most of us work from nine to five? ‘Cause nine to six might kill a bitch. "
2017,The Bird Revelation,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,7.9,8,8500,7.9,7.9,591,5631,30,"Iceberg Slim was the one that broke down what a bottom bitch was. Does anyone know what a bottom bitch is? Anyone? What's a bottom bitch, sir? It's your, uh– it's your prostitute that's the best out of all of 'em, that bring in the most money. That's right. That's exactly right. Are you black? That's right. A bottom bitch is a pimp's number one ho. She's even a bitch that helps him keep the other bitches in line. I will repeat. She's even the bitch that helps him keep the other bitches in line. If the pimp was McDonald's, then the bottom bitch is his French fries. The rest of them bitches like fish sandwiches and cherry pies and shit like that. "
2017,The Bird Revelation,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,7.9,8,8500,7.9,7.9,591,5631,31,"Iceberg Slim breaks down some of the coldest capitalist concepts I've ever heard in my life. He describes in detail how these men break women so that they will give them the money that they make with their own bodies. There's a story in here so cold, it makes me shudder to think about it. Iceberg Slim is trying to control the woman that he finds uncontrollable. So he asks an older pimp how he can rein her in. And the older pimp says, ""Oh, that's easy, Iceberg. All you have to do is beat that bitch with a coat hanger. And then run her a bath. And give her some pills. She'll be so grateful that you fixed her, that she'll forget you were the motherfucker that beat her in the first place."" That's some cold shit."
2017,The Bird Revelation,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,7.9,8,8500,7.9,7.9,591,5631,32,"Now. At the end of this book, Iceberg Slim tells a story. It's kind of the crescendo of the book. And in the story, Iceberg Slim's bottom bitch is at the end of her mileage. If she was good for 500 fucks, she was at for 498. She was bubbling, you could see it. She was going crazy. She started saying all kinds of shit. ""I always wanted to be in the circus."" Circus? This bitch is losing it. ""I can juggle, too, you know?"" Juggle? He had to let her go. It was hard to let a bottom bitch go, and he wasn't ready to let her go because his organization couldn't handle losing her. But she didn't know that. She didn't know how important she was. So what he did was, he called her to ignite her. He said, ""Look, bitch, you and I got to part ways."" She said, ""Fine, motherfucker, I don't need you anyway, because I know somebody at Ringling Brothers."""
2017,The Bird Revelation,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,7.9,8,8500,7.9,7.9,591,5631,33,"He was like, ""All right, whatever. [laughing] I got one last trick for you. It's a big money trick. You do this for me, you get paid, I get paid, and we go our separate ways."" She said, ""Fine, motherfucker, what do you want me to do?"" He said, ""Okay, there's a guy in that hotel across the street. He's waiting for you in room number seven. I want you to go over there and fuck him. But before you do, I need to put some of this stuff in his drink. And then he's gonna fall asleep. When he does, his briefcase on his bed, bring the briefcase to me. That's the trick, bitch. Can you handle it?"" She said, ""Fuck yeah, I can. I can't wait to get rid of you."" And then she ran outside, jumped on a unicycle and peddled across the street. And Iceberg watched her. He's like, ""Man, she's pretty good."" ""If I never jerked off in her face, maybe she would've been in the circus now."" "
2017,The Bird Revelation,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,7.9,8,8500,7.9,7.9,591,5631,34,"And she runs up the motel steps and disappears in room number seven. She's gone for a real long time. Real long time. So long, in fact, that Iceberg got a little worried. But then, suddenly, she came back. He says, ""Where's the briefcase?"" She said, ""I didn't get it, Daddy."" ""What do you mean you didn't? What's wrong with you?"" She said, ""I did everything you said, but that man didn't look right. Something wrong, Daddy."" ""What do you mean? Did you put that stuff in his drink?"" ""I did everything you said, Daddy. I put all of it in his drink."" He said, ""Wait a minute, bitch, you put all of it in his drink?"" Now he had to see for himself. So the two of them go to the motel, and they go into room number seven. And on the bed laying lifelessly is the white man that she was supposed to fuck. Iceberg said, ""You right, bitch. He don't look good. What the fuck?"" "
2017,The Bird Revelation,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,7.9,8,8500,7.9,7.9,591,5631,35,"So he called a friend of his that was a doctor that was close by. And the doctor came in, gave the guy a thorough examination and told them both what was obvious. ""Slim, this motherfucker is dead."" ""Oh, God, Daddy. Oh, no. Oh, no. We killed him!"" He said, ""Calm down, bitch. We didn't do anything. You killed this motherfucker."" And then he reached on the bed and he grabbed the briefcase. He popped it open. It was filled with money. More than any of them had ever seen. Iceberg took a little bit of the money and gave it to the doctor, and the doctor left discreetly. ""All right, bitch, let me think. I can fix this for you. I know somebody I can call. But if I call him, I'm gonna owe these motherfuckers a big favor."" ""Oh, God, Daddy, please. I don't want to go to jail."" ""Neither do I, bitch, so you shut up."""
2017,The Bird Revelation,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,7.9,8,8500,7.9,7.9,591,5631,36,"He picked up the phone. She heard him mumbling in the phone a little bit. He hung up the phone, and then she was pacing the room, and he was just standing there cool, and they were waiting and waiting, and then suddenly, a van pulled up downstairs. Two guys get out with a carpet. They walk upstairs, they roll that carpet out on the floor, they throw the body in the carpet. They roll that motherfucker up like a burrito, they pick that shit up, and they throw it in the back of the van. They come back up and Iceberg opens the briefcase again and gives them a little money. He says, ""I'll get in touch with you guys later."" They say, ""You're not going to get in touch with us, we'll find you."" He said, ""Whatever, nigga."" And they bounced. ""Oh, God, Daddy. Oh, God."" He says, ""Relax, bitch. Listen. We getting the fuck out of here. You go downstairs and you get the car. We gotta leave separately."" She went, she got the car. Iceberg grabbed that briefcase, waited a few minutes, looked out the window, and then he went down with her. They both got in the car, and they drove off. She was a blubbering mess. ""Oh! Oh, we did all this shit!"" He said, ""I told you bitch. We didn't do anything."" You killed the motherfucker, and I cleaned him up, and now we got us a secret. Okay? I know I'm not going to tell, bitch, is you?"" ""Oh, no, I ain't gonna tell."" He said, ""All right, baby, cool. I'm gonna need you to stay with me for a while till this shit cools down.""

She was at for 498, she ended up tricking for Iceberg for another six months. She must have turned another 200 tricks for him. Do you understand? That's some cold shit. And the cold shit about it is that the dead guy on the bed wasn't even dead at all. This motherfucker was just a friend of Iceberg's acting like he's asleep. The doctor wasn't a doctor. He was a motherfucking butcher that happened to have a white coat. And the dudes who came in the moving van clothes was dressed like movers because they were movers. Iceberg had gotten a new apartment. And the bag of money... was Iceberg's money in the first place. The money he got from all those women. That's a cold game. That's the motherfucking capitalist manifesto, and that's why I went to South Africa. So now we got us a little secret, bitch

You got to get the fuck out of the casino while the getting's good, while you're still winning. If you don't walk away from the table, that's how niggasget Kevin Harted. You already know. That's my man. I'm just saying, if he got a sex tape out... well, it's just a matter of time for me. But you know why I be thinking sometimes I wanna stop doing comedy, and you know... I don't wanna sound like a braggart saying this, but the real, like, reason I wanna stop is because I'm too goddamn good at it. I'm dope, nigga, like– I'm not even– I'm not even exaggerating. It's not exciting. Every night before I come out on stage, I'll be backstage like, ""I'm sure this is gonna go well."" And it always does."

I will write a punch line with no particular setup in mind. I just put it on a scrap of paper, and I'll throw that scrap of paper in my fishbowl. I have a fishbowl in my house filled with random punch lines. And every once in a while, I'll shake the bowl and I'll dig in there and pull one out, and see if I can make that shit work. And I picked one for this special. It's not an easy punch line to pull off. Are you ready? Yeah. Here it goes. The punch line is, ""So I kicked her in the pussy."" I haven't finished the joke yet. I just know whatever happens in the beginning of the joke, at the end of the joke, for some reason, I'm gonna kick somebody in the pussy, and it's going to be hilarious. You know what's weird?

Yeah. Yes. Common misconception about me and DC, a lot of people think I'm from the ‘hood'. That's not true. But I never bothered to correct anybody... because I wanted the streets to embrace me. As a matter of fact, I kept it up as a ruse. Like sometimes I'll hang out with rappers like Nas and them, and these motherfuckers start talking about the projects. ""Yo, it was wild in the PJs, yo."" And I'll be like, ""Word, nigga, word."" But I don't know. I have no idea. My parents did just well enough so that I could grow up poor around white people. To be honest, when Nas and them talk about the projects, nigga, I used to get jealous. Because it sounded fun. Everybody in the projects was poor, and that's fair. But if you were poor in Silver Spring, nigga, it felt like it was only happening to you. Nas does not know the pain... of that first sleepover at a white friend's house. When you come back home on Sunday and just look at your parents like... ""Y'all need to step your game up. Everything at Timmy's house works."" Remember the first time you saw that?

He moved to Silver Spring from Utah of all places. I guess his family was affiliated with that Mormon church they got down there. Me and him used to hang out. One day, I was at his house, just hanging out, and Timmy says, ""Dave, why don't you stay for dinner tonight?"" I said, ""Oh, man, I'd love to, but I can't."" If I'm not home before dark, my mother will kill me."" That was a lie. My mother had several jobs. I hadn't seen her in three or four days. And the only reason I lied to Timmy was because at that point in my life, it was my experience that white dinner wasn't delicious. I'd rather go home and fry some bologna or some shit like that. But then old Timmy threw me a curveball I wasn't expecting. He said, ""Oh, it's too bad you can't stay, Dave, 'cause... Mama made Stove Top stuffing."" I said, ""What the fuck? Stove Top?

Timmy, you're not gonna believe this. Great news. Mom said I can stay."" He said, ""Fantastic."" He said, ""Why don't you come with me, and we'll help set the table, and then we can say the blessing?"" I had no interest in setting this motherfucker's table or saying these crazy-ass Mormon prayers. I just wanted the goddamn stuffing. I told Timmy, ""You know what? I'd love to help, but let me go wash my hands first."" My plan was simple. Wash my hands slowly, and by the time I'm done, the table will be set, the blessing will be said, and all that there will be left to do is eat. Went to the bathroom. I wash my hands very slowly. I must have been in there for about ten minutes. And suddenly... one of his mothers came to the door. She was like, ""Hi. David, right?"" I said, ""Yes, ma'am."" She said, ""Timmy tells me that you're planning on staying for dinner."" I said, ""I hope that's not a problem, ma'am."" She says, ""No, it's no problem. We'd love to have you.

Beautiful couple. The wife... The wife was obviously Asian. You could see it in her face. The husband... this motherfucker was mysterious, to say the least. Couldn't quite pinpoint where he was from. Caramel-colored fella, very nice hair, but he could have been from anywhere. Bangladesh, Mexico. I can't guess with a nigga like this. All I knew for sure about this guy... was that his wife was a bitch. I could see that in her face, too.

She didn't just leave. She had to take one last dig at me on the way out. ""I will never buy one of your fucking DVDs again, Dave Chappelle."" I said, ""Ma'am, with all due respect...

If it was just women that felt that way or black dudes and Mexican dudes being like, ""Hey, ya'll, we feel like girls inside."" They'd be like, ""Shut up, nigger. No one asked you how you felt.

And it's humbling. ‘Cause you realize that this woman lied and that lie caused a murder. But that murder set in motion a sequence of events that made my wonderful life possible. That made this very night possible. How could this be that this lie could make the world a better place? It's maddening. And that's how I feel about this president. I feel like this motherfucker might be the lie that saves us all. Because I have never felt more American than when we all hate on this motherfucker together. Jesus Christ. It's good. And when it happens, I can see everybody that's stuggling. So if I'm on stage and I tell a joke that makes you want to beat up a transgender, then you're probably a piece of shit and don't come see me anymore. Or if you don't understand that when a football player takes a knee during the national anthem, he's actually standing up for me, then you might not want to fuck with me anymore. ‘Cause I swear no matter how bad it gets, you're my countrymen, and I know for a fact that I'm determined to work shit out with y'all.

You didn't eat that banana recently, motherfucker. You had that shit waiting on me. And the whole crowd was white, so it just got instantly creepy, and everyone looked like they were looking at 12 Years a Slave. They were all just like... Who the fuck does that? And then they arrested the guy, which was... I said, ""Someone's gonna fuck you in the butt in the holding cell. You know that, right? You can't just be throwing banana peels at Dave Chappelle.

So, this was a few winters ago. Oh, I didn't know you would ever clap for that. Well, all right. That's the first time that shit's ever happened. ""Ohio?!"" Anyway... I live amongst the whites. Small town in Ohio. And it was wintertime, and it had snowed recently, so there's huge snowdrifts on the street. I was walking with my sister. Now, my sister was dressed in all Muslim garb, as were her children, and I was dressed as Dave Chappelle. And we were walking and just talking about something, and a car sped around the corner, and the window came down, and somebody threw a snowball and hit me right in my shoulder. I didn't know what was going on. Why was this happening? Because I'm black? Because she's Muslim? Because I'm Dave Chappelle? I couldn't tell. But, again, I knew it was premeditated. Because who the fuck has a snowball in a warm car? But he didn't think it all the way through, lady. Because he went around the corner and got stopped at a red light. He was caught in the traffic. So, I ran out into the street, and I just tapped on his window. ""My man, could I just talk to you guys for a second? Come on out for one second. I just want to talk to you."" There's four young white dudes in the car. They're like, ""Just chill, bro."" I said, ""Relax. I just want to talk."" Now, this is an old black trick. Really, I didn't want to talk. I was gonna fuck 'em up. So, if you're ever caught in traffic, and a black guy starts saying he just wants to talk to you, don't open the door. Even if he's me, smiling at you."

""Let me help you, motherfuckker. Let me just help you out."" And I didn't notice his window was down. And he threw a snowball, that shit hit me right in my chest. Pow! He said, ""fuckk you, you fuckking nigger!"" And then the light turned green and they sped off. And I smiled from ear to ear. I looked at my sister, and she said, ""I got the plates."" And I was happy as shit because throwing a snowball at a motherfuckker is a misdemeanor assault. But if you call him a nigger when you do it, that's a felony hate crime.

I don't want this goddamn stuff in my vicinity."" And another white guy was like, ""Yeah! I didn't like it, either!"" And then an old white guy stepped out of the crowd and said, ""Young man, if you're going to fill out a police report, I would like to come with you and do the same."" I said, ""You guys would do that for me?"" And the whole crowd said, ""Hooray!"" I said, ""Come on, y'all!"" I looked like Malcolm X going to see Brother Johnson with a trail of white people."

They flew them in a private jet straight to Atlanta, to the CDC. I didn't even know CDC saw patients. There it was said they administered what The New York Times called ""a secret serum."" I don't know what's in it. It's just like Colonel Sanders' recipe. But both of these motherfuckers survived. These doctors, thank God, are healthy.

But if I was a heroin addict and I had a licensed physician injecting heroin in me, I should survive that. I'd just be like, ""I'm good, right? I'm good? It's not too much, is it?""

And we can also agree that that hot seat is traditionally occupied by African-Americans in general, African-American men in particular. Although, I can see that, in recent years, that seat has been occupied by Mexicans... and I daresay Arabs. And we, the black Americans, would like to thank you both for your sacrifice and your struggle. We needed a break. We needed a goddamn break.

I don't think any of us tasted pussy our first time like... ""Mmm! It's good!"" It needs something."
2017,Deep In The Heart of Texas,Dave Chappelle,"Austin, TX",M,8,8,10176,7.9,8,817,6770,31,"You know, it's illegal for a gynecologist to say the word ""pussy."" They can only say ""vagina,"" or they can name individual parts medically, but they can never say shorthand, even if the gynecologist is a woman. I feel like if it was a woman gynecologist, it's cool. Like, ""Am I all right?"" She's like, ""Girl, that pussy is..."" She'd be like, ""Yeah."" I don't think men should be allowed to be gynecologists. That shit is a conflict of interest. Even when my wife was pregnant, we used to go to a gynecologist... and he'd put her legs up in that stirrup like this. He'd be like, ""All right, Mrs. Chappelle, just try to relax."" I'd push him. ""Back up, motherfucker! I got this. Just tell me what to look for."" One of those homestyle checkups. There's too many ethical questions when men do that. Like, can a gynecologist lose their license... for smelling their fingers during an exam? Is that illegal? How could they not? These are men. It's like if you have a good barbeque, you don't even think about it. You just... The word ""pussy"" is only offensive if you're older. People my age and younger, I don't think we even— We dance to that shit. That song comes on the radio— ♪ I beat the pussy up ♪ That's on the radio. ♪ I beat the pussy up ♪ That's a pretty harsh song. It's nothing like a love song. There's no tracks of his tears, no midnight trains to Georgia. This man simply beats the pussy up. Unbelievable.

I don't know who in here has ever been rich before, but these are very nice parties. You know, wine and cheese and baller conversation. And there was a few eccentric types, one of which was a very wealthy man that happened to be wearing a dress. I don't know what you call him. A tranny, or a drag queen, perhaps. Whatever he was, he was definitely a man. And this man was definitely on drugs. I don't know what kind of drugs he was on, but I knew he had too much. He didn't look good. He was like this.

Why can't she just make another one in the morning? I mean, I got sons anyway. And sons love everything their dads do. My kids will be at school the next day like, ""Oh, Dad bit my sandwich.

They didn't say they were gonna catch 'em for sure, but they had the demeanor of some confident people that would catch 'em. So, I didn't worry about it too much. And then, not even a week later, five days later, I come home, and there's another videocassette sitting on my porch. As soon as I saw it, I just called the police. ""They've done it again.

I want to talk about it. The tape. I know that's why you're mad."" It was a very difficult conversation. I had to crack a few jokes. And she laughed a little, and it helped her relax, and we started talking, and then she cracked a few jokes... that hurt my feelings, honestly. But— But we talked. And you know what she told me? She told me that she was madder about the second extortion tape than she was about the first one. Which doesn't make sense at all. What's wrong with a guy touching his own private parts? It's my own business. It's not like I do it all the time. As a matter of fact, sometimes I do it for her benefit. A lot of guys do this. It's called the mercy jerk. That's the one that happens in the middle of the night when you're about to roll on top of her and you see her face, and you're like, ""She looks tired."" That takes a lot of love and discipline to back out of a room with a rock-hard dick. Sometimes I don't make it. ""Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Someone fell asleep with their socks off, didn't they?"" You can't rape feet. You can't rape feet."

You can get a good one in in two hours. That's the kind of session where you'll take all your clothes off. I'll be butt-naked in the living room like, ""Get these fucking toys out of my way!"" Disgusting. Foot on the coffee table, just stroking it out, taking my time. And I got a bowl of cereal waiting for me right here. That's when you have that privacy. You can have a loud orgasm. I miss those. [screaming] You know, when a guy busts a nut, right after that, there's a window of six minutes where he does the most rational thinking he ever does. That's when he's always horrified.

The article goes on to say I was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. I was booed. I did not leave. It was a long bomb. It was a fucking nightmare. Two puffs of weed, that's all it was. Two puffs. I never had that happen, where I take two puffs of weed, I looked at the guy next to me, I was like, ""I'm gonna bomb, niggaa. I can feel it."" And that guy called my name. ""Dave Chappelle!"" niggaa s was like... Normally, when you do a comedy show– you guys don't know what it looks like up here, but niggaa s be just looking up at you like... That's how the show started. Didn't take long for their faces to switch up like, ""What the fuck?"" They started looking amongst themselves. So I knew I wasn't doing good. I don't remember what I was saying. It just took one person to break the ice. It was a black lady with a Ford Motor shirt on. Stood up suddenly. ""Fuck you, Dave Chappelle!"" I said, ""Excuse me?"" She said, ""I worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!"" And in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. ""Yeah!"" The whole crowd banded together and started chanting, ""We want our money back! We want our money back!"" I said, ""Oh, shit."" I snapped out of it. ""Good people of Detroit, hear me. Hear me now.

I bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around Detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. I was very mad at Detroit that night.

I was coming out of one of those nightclubs in Hollywood, and my friend saw me. I guess I was wobbling or something. So, he just rolled up. He's a good friend of mine. He's like, ""Hey, Dave, give me the keys."" I was like, ""All right, nigga, just take the keys."" And I got in the passenger's side of my car, and he drove it. It was fine. Just talking, chopping it up. And then, on the 10, the blue-and-whites hit us.

And you're doing really good work, and I hope good things happen for you in your life."" I was like, ""Man, thanks, Mr. Juice.""

Just man the fuck up. She's dead. We already know what happened. We don't know who did it, but we know what happened. I should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. She actually embraced me.

He stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. I was sitting in the corner of the booth.

They're just not nice dudes. They're fucking rude houseguests. They're sitting on my couch, giggling with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons. Then I come in, and they act like the party's over. ""Hey, Stewart. What's going on?"" This guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk. ""Hi, David."" ""Stewart, what's all the beef, man? What's going–"" He always wants to have some kind of gay political argument. The last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words ""husband and wife"" out of the law. I said, ""Why would you want those words out of the law?"" He said, ""Because it discriminates against same-sex couples."" I was like, ""nigga s, please, save me the semantics. Just trust me. Take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino. You're about to crap out! Just go outside, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, that's the wife."" No, no. Stewart didn't like that. Stewart educates me about this movement. I didn't even know shit about it. He told me it's called ""LBGTQ!"" I was like, ""What the fuck is the ‘Q'?"" Does that even make sense? ""Q""? Turns out ""Q"" is like the vowels. That shit is sometimes ""Y."" It's for gay dudes that don't really know they're gay. Like prison fags who are like, ""What? I'm not gay, nigga. I'm just sucking these dicks to pass the time. I'm not ‘G.' I'm ‘Q.' Ugh."" I think– Okay, again, of all those letters, the ""T"" has the toughest road ahead. In fact, I think the ""T"" should stand for ""Tough road ahead."""
2017,The Age of Spin,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,8.1,8,10937,8,8.1,899,7228,28,"They've got the longest mental gap to bridge. That's all I'm saying. Because whenever I see one of them Ts on the street, I don't mind them, but I'll be like, ""Man, I miss Bruce."" I'm sorry, guys. I'm 42. I remember Bruce Jenner. Before the Kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white American superhero. It was amazing. He was beating Africans at track and field. We'd never seen anything like it. He was on my cereal box growing up. You know how much of that cereal I ate? nigga, I didn't know he was gonna do that. I knew before you guys knew. I heard things on the street in Hollywood. You'd just be out, see people. ""Hey, what's up, Kanye? Why the long face?"" ""nigga, you'll see. I got two mother-in-laws now."" And when I heard he was gonna do it, I was scared. I didn't think the public was ready. I didn't think the media was ready. And you know what? I was wrong. Not only did the public embrace him, but the media was nice. I'd never seen anything like it. ""Welcome to the world, Caitlyn. So long, Bruce. Hello, Caitlyn."" I was shocked! Is this happening?"
2017,The Age of Spin,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,8.1,8,10937,8,8.1,899,7228,29,"Wait a minute. Is this a time in American history where an American can make a decision for themselves, and even though other Americans don't understand it, they'll support it and let this person live a happy life? Is this what's happening? If it is, then good for America. That's Dave Chappelle, the American. Although, Dave Chappelle, the black American, he was a little jealous. I was like, ""How the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination Olympics?"" If the police shot half as many transgenders as they did niggaslast year, there'd be a fucking war in LA. I know black dudes in Brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe. Transgenders are gangsters. I used to do business with a transgender in Hollywood. Man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom. She'd walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse. Wouldn't say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit. Then she'd walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table. ""Let's talk business, gentlemen."" ""Aaah!"" Shit is scary as fuck. If your best friend pitched that to you, you'd be horrified. ""Yo, nigga, let's go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits."" ""What?! Can't we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something? You sure that's what you want to do?"" ""There's only way to find out, nigga. Wu-Tang! Pow! Pow! Let's go to the club and trick niggasinto fucking us. Yeah."""
2017,The Age of Spin,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,8.1,8,10937,8,8.1,899,7228,30,"The third time I met OJ Simpson— The third time I met OJ Simpson, I was doing great in life. I'd just finished the second season of Chappelle's Show. Man, those were good days. I was playing a comedy club in Miami, The Improv. I don't know if you've ever been, but if you have, you'd know the door for the green room is right on the stage. Can you imagine such a thing? If I walked out of the door of the green room, bam, I was right here, right from the dressing room. And I did that. I walked out, and the whole crowd was like, ""Hooray!"" And I looked– ma'am, as close as you are to me– I saw him as soon as I came out: The Juice. And I saw recognition in his eyes, and it filled me with pride that he knew who I was. I didn't acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience, and I didn't want to start a panic. But I did my show. The show went great. I said, ""Good night, everyone."" They all said, ""Yay!"" And I didn't say nothing to OJ, but I just gave him the signal to let him know I knew he was there. "
2017,The Age of Spin,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,8.1,8,10937,8,8.1,899,7228,31,"And I walked into the green room, and OJ was already in there! I was like, ""How the fuck is this possible?"" I was scared. And then my friends came in, and we all started talking. We sat down on the couch. And I'm just telling you what I saw with my own eyes. You can believe me or not believe me. But in my experience, OJ Simpson– one of the nicest men I'd ever met. He was nice to me. He was nice to my friends. The conversation was filled with warmth and levity, humor and wisdom. We talked for minutes, and then suddenly, the Juice said, ""You know what? I've got to be going. But it's good to see you again, and I'm glad things went so well."" I said, ""Thanks, Juice."" And my friends said, ""Yeah, goodbye, Mr. Juice."" They were new to the game. He said, ""No. Thank you... for your hospitality. Good night, guys."" And we said, ""Good night."" And he just walked out of the room. And as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like, ""That nigga did that shit. Did you feel that? I could feel like... murder in the room."""
2017,The Age of Spin,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,8.1,8,10937,8,8.1,899,7228,32,"Well, you young heads missed that shit. You're all too young. You don't remember that. -How old are you, young, man? You. -Twenty-four. Twenty-four? You don't know shit. You don't know shit! You gotta Google shit that I lived through. See, this is why I lock motherfuckers' phones up. Seriously. Because the young kids, you guys need to take a break from that– We all need to break just from that technology, just for a minute. You know, I'm from a different time, young man. A dark time to you. I'm from a time that I didn't even used to know who was on the phone until I answered the shit. Like, when tragedy used to strike."
2017,The Age of Spin,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,8.1,8,10937,8,8.1,899,7228,33,"I remember I was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom. You remember these days? And she turned it on to one of three channels. And she said, ""Class, the space shuttle is taking off, and we're all gonna watch it take off."" Man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes. That's right. You remember. It fucking exploded! Right on television. Everybody on board, dead. Immediately presumed dead. It was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like... ""You can go home."" It was a goddamn national tragedy. This was Cold War America. The Russians were laughing at us."
2017,The Age of Spin,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,8.1,8,10937,8,8.1,899,7228,34,"My point is, for a guy your age wouldn't even know the pain, because in your generation, it's like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day. How can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing? I'm getting over one cop shooting, and then another one happens, and then another one happens, and another one happens. I'm crying about Paris, and then Brussels happens. I can't keep track of all this shit. So you just give the fuck up. That's the hallmark of your generation, and that's fucked up, because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history. This is the age of spin. The age where nobody knows what the fuck they're even looking at. Did you know that Planned Parenthood was for abortions? It's for people that don't plan things out at all. That's right. So, a guy your age doesn't really know how he feels. Are you pro-choice? Are you anti-consequences? What does it all really mean? It's easier not to care for you. But for us, we were trained to care. We were raised that way."
2017,The Age of Spin,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,8.1,8,10937,8,8.1,899,7228,35,"I used to watch a fucking cartoon when I was growing up called Care Bears. It was about a fucking group of teddy-bear people. They were like teddy bears, but they were like people, and they were all different colors, and they all fucking just walked around, caring. They cared about each other and everything else. They all had different designs on their stomachs, and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside. Very, very loving group of beings. And when shit got real bad, as nice as those teddy bears were, they didn't get mean faces. They got determined. Hmm! And the leader would say, ""Come on, guys. It's time for the Care Bear Stare!"" Remember that shit? And them little teddy bears would lock arms... and stare at the problem– and I'm not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests... and would dispel anything that was fucked up. And when we grew up, we wanted to be like those bears. And then we got our hearts broken, because we found out that life wasn't gonna let us do that and that it's impossible to shoot love out of your chest."
2017,The Age of Spin,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,8.1,8,10937,8,8.1,899,7228,36,"However, I have shot love onto somebody's chest before. I do it all the time. It's the next best thing. You kids don't know. Your generation is just determined to be angry, mad. Everybody's mad. Back when we were growing up, only black people were mad. Now everybody's just trying to get in on the act. I try to think to myself, ""When did everyone get mad?"" And then I realize this happened before we were born. This is a long way to go, but... it probably started in the Second World War. Think about it. All these black men, millions of black men, leave the United States for the first time, go over to Europe with America's Armed Forces and fight the Nazis and make more money fighting Nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the United States. And a lot of those men, while they were in Europe– just to be real, not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women. I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen. This was World War II Europe, and these were desperate times, and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things. And it's very hard to come back to America and sit on the back of the bus after you've been in the South of France, getting your dick sucked for a Crunch bar or some crazy shit like that. That's a life-changing experience. And while that was happening in Europe, here in America, for the first time, women entered the workforce en masse, by the millions. All the men were gone. Someone had to run the factory. The ladies did it. That's right. This was the first generation of American women to have independent income en masse, and when the men came back, the women weren't the same. American women had grown. They were uttering phrases that no woman on Earth had ever spoken before, things like, ""No"" and ""Shut the fuck up"" and ""I don't feel like it."""
2017,The Age of Spin,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,8.1,8,10937,8,8.1,899,7228,37,"And then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the American public. They fucked up. They tested it for 12 years. They didn't realize these drugs were not mind-controlling. They were mind-expanding. It was LSD and mescaline and shit like that. And for the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in. By 1960, the President of the United States was only 42 years old. Can you imagine? DMX is older than that. And he was gonna usher in a new era of peace. He was gonna avoid the Cold War. He was gonna end segregation. And they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in Dallas. This country was never the same. There were seven more major assassinations in the '60s. Anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog. Kennedy, Kennedy, King, X, Evers, on and on. You didn't even have to be famous. You could be a college student at Kent State, or in Mississippi, protesting the Vietnam War, and they shot them, too."
2017,The Age of Spin,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,8.1,8,10937,8,8.1,899,7228,38,"The '70s were a wild era. And while all this was going on... Bill Cosby raped 54 people. Holy shit. That's a lot of rapes, man. This guy's putting up real numbers. He's like the Steph Curry of rape. Man, that's a lot of rapes. Fifty-four? If he had raped less people... that's still two dozen rapes! Don't forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. Ladies and gentlemen, that's over hours of rape. It only takes hours to get a pilot's license. If rapes were aircrafts, this nigga is Top Gun for sure."
2017,The Age of Spin,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,8.1,8,10937,8,8.1,899,7228,39,"Yeah, that's a tough one. And I was onstage not too long ago. I was in Syracuse, New York. Yeah. Well, yeah, for Syracuse. But the show didn't go so good... all because I was talking about Bill Cosby a little bit. Not a little bit. I'll be honest. I talked about him for like, minutes. And a woman stood up in the back of the room, and she screamed out, ""You are a fucking asshole for saying these things!"" ""I know."" Instantly, I felt bad. Not bad about what I was saying. I just felt bad like, ""Oh, that's too bad she doesn't like the show."" I didn't realize it at first, but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. By the time I saw her, I just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. I was horrified. I said, ""Oh, my God! I'm gonna kick this bitch in the face."" Lucky for me, I didn't have to. Security tackled her. But it was a really fucking horrifying scene. A scuffle ensued. And then, finally, she screamed out to me, ""Women suffer!"" I said, ""I know."" And, ladies, "

Seriously, there's a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. I would include myself in that. Don't ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. There's a lot of men like that in this room. There's a lot of men like that in the world. Or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass nigga s. But as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, I started to take offense. And I'll be honest, race was involved. She was a young white woman. Well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through. ""Bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?"" She didn't get it. She just kept going. ""Women suffer!"" ""I know."" ""Women suffer!"" ""Same team."" ""Women suffer!"" ""I know."" And this is when she went too far: ""We suffer just like you."" ""Slow your roll, bitch. You suffer, yes, but not like me. Not like us."" She goes, ""Suffering is suffering. What's the difference?"" I said, ""Come on, white woman, you know what it is. You was in on the heist. You just don't like your cut."" You suffer, I suffer. You suffer, I suffer. That's how it works."

If you're hungry, and your friend says, ""You know, people are starving in Africa,"" ""So what, nigga? I still want lunch."" Black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that it's a fucking dead-end game. Blacks and Jews do that shit to each other all the time. You ever played Who Suffered More with a Jewish person? It's a tough game. Whenever you think you've got the Jewish guy on the ropes, that motherfucker will be like, ""Well, don't forget about Egypt."" ""Egypt?! God damn, nigga, I didn't know we was going all the way back to Egypt."" What the fuck is wrong with her? What does she think? Does she think that I don't know that rape is wrong? Does she think that maybe I don't have empathy for Bill Cosby's alleged victims? And I would be remiss if I didn't remind you that technically these are all still allegations. Although, I admit it looks very bad. Perhaps if she looked at it correctly, she would have empathy for me, the man she was attacking, a 42-year-old black comedian."
2017,The Age of Spin,Dave Chappelle,"Los Angeles, CA",M,8.1,8,10937,8,8.1,899,7228,42,"Obviously, Bill Cosby was a hero to me. And she doesn't know what it feels like to think that your hero might've done something so heinous, my God, you can't imagine. It'd be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself... had raped 54 people. You'd say to yourself, ""Oh, man, but I like chocolate ice cream. I don't want it to rape."" Didn't want to believe it. At first, I didn't believe it. I said, ""These people are obviously trying to destroy Dr. Cosby's rich legacy."" Even 34 allegations into it, I was still like, ""Man... he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people."" I know, I know. But it's really tough."

You'd be like, ""Oh, my God."" The only one that would believe that would be Katt Williams. He'd be like, ""I knew that motherfucker was up to something! I knew Kevin had raped those people."" You know, I was mad at Kevin, too, though. You know why? Okay, first of all, I didn't even know Kevin was as successful as he was. I found that shit out the hard way. I was at home when my son busted in. He said, ""Dad, I need $250."" He's only years old, so I freaked out. ""What's going on, nigga? Is somebody trying to kill you?"" He said, ""No, no. Kevin Hart's coming to town, and I wanted to see his show."" I said, ""How much are the tickets?"" He said, ""They're $125."" I said, ""God damn! Mine are only 80."" I said, ""Why do you need $250, then?"" He goes, ""Because I want to go with you, Dad. Please? And there it is. So, I took him to the show. And we go, we sit right up front. The lights go down, and one opening act after another goes on. Then Kevin takes the stage. The crowd goes fucking nuts. Thousands of people. I was furious. The longer the show went on, the madder I got. Because his show was fucking outstanding. It was maddening. These people were fucking holding their stomachs. My son was slapping his knee. I'm like, ""Damn, nigga, I do this, too."" Kevin says, ""Good night."" "

I was like, ""Oh, my God."" So, I took him backstage. I've known Kevin for years, but can you believe I was scared to knock on his dressing room door? I almost said... ""Son, I haven't seen him for a long time."" And one of Kevin's goons opened the door. ""Hey, what's up, Dave Chappelle? What are you doing, man? It's good to see you, brother. What are you doing in this area? This is a terrible area."" I'm like, ""Actually, I live around here. Listen... is Kevin here? My son just wanted to meet him real quick."" ""I don't know, 'cause Kevin's about to eat dinner."" Just then, Kevin came around the corner to see who it was. ""What? Oh, shit! What's up, Dave? Come on back. I was just about to have dinner. I don't know if you guys ate, but you're welcome to join me if you'd like."" And then my son pushed passed me. It was some cold shit.

This motherfucker was having Sunday dinner. There were steaks, chops, corn with butter all over it. My son was eating all fast, embarrassing me. I was like, ""Slow down, son."" He was like... Then I looked over in the corner, and there was a box of custom-made jerseys for the local team. Each one was hand-stitched, and on the back, they stitched on ""K-Hart"" on all of them. Kevin saw me staring at that box, and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys, and he walked right to my son. He said, ""Hey, little man. I want you to have this."" And my son was like, ""Thanks, Mr. Hart."" This is when I got mad. He goes, ""If your father ever makes you mad, put that on."" And he walked out. Oh, that was some cold shit. Then I realized– I looked up what Kevin made on Google. I couldn't believe that shit. Kevin is the first comedian that a Drake song could be about.

Let's just remember that he has a valuable legacy that I can't just throw away. I remember that he's the first black man to ever win an Emmy in television. I also remember that he's the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately. I remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the Super Bowl every Thursday night. And I remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of African-Americans on his show. I'm telling you, that's no small thing. I've had a television show. I wouldn't have done that shit. He gave tens of millions of dollars to African-American institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college. Not just the ones he raped. Here comes the kicker. You ready? Here's the fact that I heard, but haven't confirmed. I heard that when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a PA system that Bill Cosby paid for. So, you understand what I'm saying? The point is this: He rapes, but he saves. And he saves more than he rapes. But he probably does rape. Thank you very much! Good night!"

And then, I just never saw him again for years, and then, two years ago, I was home in DC doing some shoppin', tryin' to buy my sons some socks at Foot Locker. I go to Foot Locker. Guess who's the manager? That nigga. Dressed like a referee, the whole shit. This motherfucker is 45 years old! We went out drinking that night just tryin' to catch up, and... and he told me.

I want to see if you can guess who it is I'm doing an impression of. All right? Let me get into character. You gotta guess who it is, though. Okay, here it goes. Uh, duh. Hey! Durr! If you do anything wrong in your life, duh, and I find out about it, I'm gonna try to take everything away from you, and I don't care when I find out. Could be today, tomorrow, 15, 20 years from now. If I find out, you're fucking-duh-finished. "
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,7,"That's YOU! That's what the audience sounds like to me. That's why I don't be coming out doing comedy all the time, 'cause y'all niggasis the worst motherfuckers I've ever tried to entertain in my FUCKING life. Ugh. I'm goddamn sick of it. This is the worst time ever to be a celebrity. You're gonna be finished. Everyone's doomed. Michael Jackson has been dead for ten years and this nigga has two new cases. And if you haven't watched that documentary... uh, then I'm begging you, don't watch it. It's fucking gross. I felt like HBO was sticking baby dicks in my ears for four hours straight. Really nasty shit. I don't want to know all these things. Turns out, uh, Michael Jackson allegedly likes a long gander at the anus. They said he stares at people's buttholes. That's what they said. That's how gross the documentary was."
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,8,"I'm gonna say something that I'm not allowed to say. But I gotta be real. Uh... I don't believe these motherfuckers. I do not believe them. But... let me qualify the statement. I... I am what's known on the streets as a victim blamer. You know what I mean? If somebody come up to me like, ""Dave, Dave, Chris Brown just beat up Rihanna."" I'll be like, ""Well, what did she do?"" ""Dave, Michael Jackson was molesting children."" ""Well, what were those kids wearing at the time?"" I don't think he did it. But you know what? Even if he did do it... You know what I mean? You know what I mean? Eh... I mean, it's Michael Jackson. I know more than half the people in this room have been molested in their lives. But it wasn't no goddamn Michael Jackson, was it? This kid got his dick sucked by the King of Pop. All we get is awkward Thanksgivings for the rest of our lives."
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,9,"You know how good it must've felt to go to school the next day after that shit? ""Hey, Billy, how was the weekend?"" ""How was my weekend? Michael Jackson sucked my dick! And that was my first sexual experience. If I'm starting here, then sky's the limit!"" I know it seems harsh, but, man, somebody's gotta teach these kids. There's no such thing as a free trip to Hawaii. He's gonna want to look at your butthole or something. You know why I don't believe it? You know why I don't believe it? Because if Michael Jackson's out here doing all this molesting, then– then why not Macaulay Culkin? Hmm? Macaulay Culkin stated in an interview that Michael Jackson never did anything inappropriate with him or even around him. Think about that shit. You know... I'm not a pedophile. But if I was... Macaulay Culkin's the first kid I'm fucking, I'll tell you that right now. I'd be a goddamn hero. ""Hey, that guy over there fucked the kid from Home Alone. And you know how hard he is to catch."""
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,10,"Well, okay. R. Kelly is different. I mean, you know, if I'm a bettin' man, I'm gonna put my money on ""He probably did that shit."" I'm pretty sure he did that shit. You know, it was bad, okay, so a couple years ago, I was doing a show in Detroit. And I'm sitting backstage in my dressing room and a friend of mine comes by, this chick, Dream Hampton. Dream, uh, tells me, right before I'm going on stage, she goes, ""Dave, I'm working on a documentary about R. Kelly. ""Would you like to be in it?"" And I was like, ""Nah, bitch, I'm cool."" I went onstage, I just forgot about the shit, and then two years later, the documentary comes out, Surviving R. Kelly. And when it comes out, Dream's promotin' shit and she keeps bringing me up. She said, ""I asked Dave Chappelle to be in my documentary, and he said it was too hot for TV."" Bitch, I did not say that. That does not even sound like how I talk. ""Oh, that's too hot for TV."" I would never say that shit."
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,11,"But I'm gonna tell you guys why I wasn't in the documentary. It's a very simple reason, and, uh, I cannot stress this point enough. The only reason that I didn't do it was because, and this is very important... I don't know this nigga at all! I don't know anything! I don't know anything that they don't tell me about. I don't hang out with this nigga. Nothing. So what the fuck do I got to be in the documentary for? This guy, R. Kelly, got another sex tape out now. Can you believe that shit? This guy makes more sex tapes than he does music. He's like the DJ Khaled of sex tapes. ""Another one."" Like, damn, nigga! That's a lot of tapes. The new one's so bad that they didn't even show it. I've never seen anything like this. The prosecutor in Chicago came out in a press conference and read to the media a transcript of a sex tape. Have you ever heard of such a thing? This nigga read the sex tape. And it was so bad that R. Kelly sounded guilty in the transcripts. It's fucking amazing. Sixteen times the girl's age was mentioned. Isn't that crazy? This motherfucker is an idiot. He was fuckin' her like, ""Yeah, this is the best 14-year-old pussy I've ever had in my life."" She was like, ""You like this 14-year-old pussy?"" Like, ""Oh, yeah, I love this."" I'm like, ""Man, you need to shut the fuck up."" You gotta give your lawyer something to work with. You supposed to be on the tape like, ""This is the best... 36-year-old pussy I've ever had in my life."" Then your lawyer can be like, ""Your Honor, clearly my client thought that this woman was 36, as he mentioned some 16 times in the tape."""
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,12,"They gonna know you lying, though, you know what I mean. Everybody knows... no such thing as good 36-year-old pussy. Doesn't matter what I say. And if you at home watching this shit on Netflix, remember, bitch, you clicked on my face. Celebrity hunting season. Doesn't matter what I say, they're going to get everybody eventually. Like, look, I don't think I did anything wrong, but... but we'll see. They even got poor Kevin Hart. Can you imagine such a thing? Kevin Hart, let me tell you something. It was... It was Kevin Hart's dream to host the Oscars. That's what he told me. And I remember when he told me, 'cause I was thinking to myself, ""Well, that's an awfully strange dream for an African American."" What kind of nigga dreams of hosting the Oscars? Kevin did, that's who. And he did it. Against all the odds, Kevin became the most famous comedian this world has ever seen, and he got the job that only one black man before him had had. He was gonna host the 80th Oscars."
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,13,"And I don't know what you know about Kevin, but I know Kevin Hart is damn near perfect. As close to perfect as anybody I've ever seen. In fact, Kevin is precisely four tweets shy of being perfect. Ten years ago, Kevin had made some very homophobic comments. And I'm not gonna repeat what he said... because this is Atlanta. You know what I mean. I'm sure there's a lot of gay men here tonight... with their wives. Far be it from me to offend anybody. All right, I'll tell you what he said. But just remember, these are not my words. These were Kevin's words. And it was a long time ago. And I'm paraphrasing, 'cause I'm not good at telling other people's jokes. Okay, Kevin said... that if his little son was demonstrating or-or-or exhibiting, uh, homosexual behavior around the house, that he'd chastise him. He'd say, ""Hey, that's gay."" And then he said he would smash a dollhouse over that child's head."
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,14,"Ooh, the gay community was furious. And I don't blame 'em. I got a lot of gay friends. And all of them, 100% of them, all have told me fuckin' horror stories about the shit they had to go through just to be themselves. Crazy, crazy stories. And in all those stories, I gotta say, not one of them has ever mentioned anything like... their father smashing a fucking dollhouse over their head. ‘Cause, clearly, Kevin was joking. Think about it. You would have to buy this nigga a dollhouse to break it over his head in the first place. Does that sound right? Is anybody gonna do that? The gay community was upset, and then they put so much pressure on the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences that they went to Kevin and said, ""If you don't apologize to that community, then you cannot host these Oscars."" And then Kevin said, ""Fuck it, I quit."" And then he went on every talk show in America and apologized for six weeks."
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,15,"Kevin fucked up. I understand the mistake he made because I've made the same mistake early in my career. This is many years ago, 15 years ago. It was when I was doing Chappelle's Show. There's a– Thank you. Thank you. On network television, they have a department that's called Standards and Practices. This is the department that tells you what you can and cannot say on television. And if you're doing your job well, you should never hear from 'em. But if you're making Chappelle's Show, you'll hear from these motherfuckers all the time.
And remember, this was 15 years ago. I made a mistake. I didn't even know I'd done anything wrong. I had written a sketch... that had the word... ""faggot"" in it. So I had to go to Standards and Practices. They call me up. I don't know why they're calling me, but I like the lady that runs the department. She's usually really fair and was one of my favorite people I've ever worked with. So she sits me down. We have a nice conversation. She tells me, ""Oh, the sketches are great."" I go, ""Oh, fantastic. Well, then... well, then, why am I here?"" She said, ""Because, David, there's no way... that you can ever say the word... ""faggot"" on our network."
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,16,"I didn't know I did anything wrong. I didn't try to defend myself. I said, ""All right. Fuck it, I'll take it out. Have a good afternoon."" And as I was leaving, it occurred to me. ""Hey. Hey, Renée, quick question. It's just a question. Seriously, I wanna know. Like, wh-why is it... why is it that... that I can say the word ""nigger"" with impunity... ...but I can't say the word ""faggot""?"" And she said, ""Because, David, you are not gay."" I said, ""Well, Renée... I'm not a nigger either."" But, you see, what I didn't realize at the time and what Kevin had to learn the hard way is we were breaking an unwritten and unspoken rule of show business. And if I say it, you'll know that I'm telling you the truth. The rule is that no matter what you do in your artistic expression, you are never, ever, allowed to upset... the alphabet people. You know who I mean. Those people that took 20% of the alphabet for themselves. I'd say the letters, but I don't want to conjure their anger. Ah, it's too late now. I'm talking about them L's and them B's and them G's and the T's."
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,17,"People would be surprised. I have friends of all kinds of letters. Everybody loves me and I love everybody. I got friends who are L's. I got friends who are B's. And I got friends who are G's. But the T's hate my fuckin' guts. And I don't blame 'em. It's not their fault. It's mine. I can't stop telling jokes about these nigga s. I don't want to write these jokes, but I just can't stop! You know, you hear all those letters together all the time. ""LBGT, LBGT,"" and you think it's just one big movement. It's not. All those letters are their own movement. They just travel in the same car together. And... my guess is...Like I was saying... my guess is... the G's are driving that car. That makes sense to me. ‘Cause there's white men in the G's. And these people are trying to get around, uh, discrimination and oppression, and you know how white dudes are. ""We know these roads. In fact, we built these roads. ""The rest of you, buckle up. We'll get you to where you want to go."" So the G's are just driving the car. Of course, next to the G's in the passenger seat... is the L's. Everybody likes the L's, except for the G's. I don't know what that's about. I just know the G's don't like them that much. The G's always say, like, little subliminal digs on 'em. It's unnecessary shit. It's not mean, but you know what I mean? They just be like... ""I wouldn't wear that."""
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,18,"And the only thing that breaks the tension between the L's and the G's are the B's in the backseat. That's right. There you go. Everybody scream out when you hear your letter. If there's one thing that the L's and the G's agree on, is it's that the B's are fuckin' gross. They seem greedy to the L's and the G's. You know what I mean? ‘Cause they're just sittin' in the back seat like, ""Yeah, man, I'll fuck anybody in this car. What's going on, man?"" And sitting next to the B's, all the way in the backseat by themselves looking out the window... that's the T's. Everybody in the car respects the T's, but everyone also... resents the T's. It's not the T's' fault, but everyone in the car just feels like the T's are making the trip take longer. Anything the T's say gets on everybody's nerves. And then, the T's don't even say anything bad. They just be in the back talking to themselves. ""Hm... ""I'm hot."" ""Shut up. Shut the fuck up, okay? You should roll the window down, you... Bitch, I don't know what you..."" ""What? I just said I was hot. Can you pull over at the next exit? I need to use the restroom."" ""There is not a restroom for you for four states, nigga! Will you just shut the fuck up so we can get where we're going?"""
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,19,"And just when that car can't get any more tense, the Q's are a hitchhiker that they pick up on the road. Some white dude in booty shorts just walking in the freeway. The G's see him. ""Hm, that guy might be one of us. Hey, are you okay? You need some help?"" And he come over there with them booty shorts, leaning on the window. ""Hey, what's going on, fellas?"" Lady. Whatever pronoun makes you feel comfortable in the back. Yeah. I don't really know where I'm going. I don't know if I'm gay or I'm straight or whatever. All I know for sure is that, um... I really want to get in this car."" And they make him get in and sit between the B's and the T's. I feel bad for T's. But they're so confusing. And it's not all my fault. I-I feel like they need to take some responsibility for my jokes. ‘Cause I didn't come up with this idea on my own, this idea that a person can be born in the wrong body. But they have to admit that's a fucking hilarious predicament. It's really fucking funny. If it happened to me, you'd laugh. Wouldn't you? That wouldn't be funny if it happened to me? I think it would be. What if... What if it did? What if... What if I was... What if I was Chinese? But... But born in this nigga body. That's not funny? And for the rest of my life, I had to go around making that face. ""Hey, everybody, I'm Chinese!"" And everyone gets mad. ""Stop making that face. That's offensive."" -""What?"" ""This is how I feel inside."""
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,20,"It's hard not to write these jokes. It's hard not to think about it. Even when I watch sports, I'd be thinking about it. Like, think about it. Okay, say... say LeBron James, uh, changed his gender. You know what I mean? Okay. Can he stay in the NBA, or, because he's a woman, does he have to go to the WNBA where he will score 840 points a game? What does it actually mean to be equal? You know what I mean? Like, if women are actually equal to men, then there would be no WNBA, would there? You would just be good enough to play in the NBA with us."
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,21,"Or, here's another idea that's going to be very controversial, you could... shut the fuck up. I'm sorry, ladies. I just... I got a fucking Me Too headache. Y'all is killing me right now. It's really fuckin' tough to watch what's going on. You know, ladies, I said it in my last special, and I got in a lot of trouble for this. I told you, you were right. But the way you're going about it is not going to work. But I'm biased. I said it. Louis C.K. was a very good friend of mine before he died in that terrible masturbation accident. And it was his room. You read the story. He was masturbating in his own room. That's where you supposed to masturbate. Then he said, ""Hey, everybody, I'm gonna pull my dick out."" Nobody ran for the door or nothing like that. They all just kind of hung out, like, ""I wonder if this guy is serious."" And he came on his own stomach. There it is. What is the threat? Have any women ever seen a guy that just came on his own stomach? This is the least threatening motherfucker the Earth has ever seen. All you see is shame in their face and... cum dripping down like pancake butter. He didn't do anything that you can call the police for. I dare you to try. Call the police on him. ""Hello? Police, yes. I am... I am on the other line with comedian Louis C.K., and I think that he is masturbating while I'm on the phone."" You know what the police are gonna say in Atlanta? ""Well, what are you guys talking about? Mm-hm. Mm-hmm."" They ruined this nigga's life, and now he's coming back playing comedy clubs, and they acting like if he's able to do that, that's gonna hurt women."
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,22,"What the fuck is your agenda, ladies? Is– Is sexism dead? No, in fact, the opposite happened. I said it was gonna get worse, and they said I was tone deaf. But eight states, including your state, have passed the most stringent anti-abortion laws this nation has seen since Roe v. Wade. I... I told you. I told you. I'll be real with you, and I know nobody gives a fuck what I think anyway. -Uh... I'm not for abortion. -Oh, shut up, nigga. I'm not for it, but I'm not against it either. It all depends... on who I get pregnant. I don't care– I'll tell you right now. I don't care what your religious beliefs are or anything. If you have a dick, you need to shut the fuck up on this one. Seriously. This is theirs. The right to choose is their unequivocal right. Not only do I believe they have the right to choose, I believe that they shouldn't have to consult anybody, -except for a physician... ...about how they exercise that right. Gentleman, that is fair. And ladies, to be fair to us, I also believe if you decide to have the baby, a man should not have to pay. That's fair. If you can kill this motherfucker, I can at least abandon 'em. It's my money, my choice. And if I'm wrong, then perhaps we're wrong. So, figure that shit out for yourselves. I mean, really, uh, what the fuck are we doing? I can't live in this new world you're proposing."
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,23,"And meanwhile, while we're worrying about this other shit, look at what's happening. They just killed another 12 people in a mass shooting in Virginia Beach. This shit's happening every week. It happens so much, I'm almost– I don't care anymore. I came home early from the road. I had a $12,000 suit on, 'cause life's been going good. And I got home early, and dinner was cookin'. You ever come home when dinner's cookin'? Doesn't that smell good? And my son saw me, and he was like, ""Dad's home."" And he got up from the table and ran over to give me a hug, but he had chicken grease all over his face, so I stiffed on him, like, ""Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, my man, my man. Watch these threads, son. This is an expensive suit. I don't want you to get that chicken grease all over me."" A-And he was like, ""What the f... Chicken grease? Dad, this is duck."" Hmm. A tear came out of my eyes. I never dreamt I'd do so well in life that I'd raise a nigga with duck grease all over his face. And we sat down, we just talked about everything. I was telling my wife about how my shows were going, and I told her my trans jokes, and she was like, ""Oh, I hate that joke."" And you know why she hates the joke? ‘Cause she's Asian. But you know what I mean? I don't make that face at the house, u-unless we're really fightin'. And me and her, we weren't arguing, but you know what I mean? She's like, ""You need to stop doing that."""
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,24,"And then, I tried to change the subject. ""Oh, how is school going, boys?"" And my son's telling me, ""Well, we didn't have school today, technically."" I'm like, ""What... What's going on?"" He said, ""Well there was, like, a school shooting drill."" I never heard of this. You know what this is? They have drills that they make kids do, uh, where they practice what to do if somebody comes to shoot up their school. I'd never heard of that before. I was like, ""What the fuck?"" I had to tell my sons the truth. I didn't want to tell them this shit. ""Son... Son, listen to me. Fuck that drill. If somebody comes to your school and wants to shoot it up, I'm just gonna be honest with you. You probably gonna get shot, nigga. I'm just being real. You got a famous dad. I talk a lot of shit. They gonna be gunning for you, little buddy. Just stay low and run in a zigzag pattern, and don't try to save anybody, son. Do you understand me?"" Why would you have kids rehearse for some shit they have no control over? All you're doing is training these kids to worry. It's the stupidest drill I've ever heard of. And while you're in there training 'em during these drills, well, aren't you training the shooter, too? This nigga's in here listening and learning like the other kids. Sittin' in the back... ""So, where are we supposed to meet? Okay."""
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,25,"All right. If you're a parent, this shit is terrifying. This shit is real scary. All the parents is looking at each other crazy, because we know, as parents, that one of us is raising the shooter. We just don't know which one of us it is. All we know for sure... is that if you're a white parent, the chances that it's you... ...it's exponentially higher than the rest of us. Shooting up school is a white kids' game. It's fuckin' crazy. You know, I hated school, too. It never occurred to me... kill everybody in school? It's fuckin' crazy. Just do what I did, nigga. Try some things. ""Have you skipped school, nigga? Skip school! Take a walk and meet some other kids. Fuck school, nigga. Try drugs. Have you tried drugs out? nigga, that might..."" Some scary shit. I've given this a lot of thought. I don't see any peaceful way to disarm America's whites. There's only one thing that's going to save this country from itself. Same thing that always saves this country from itself, and that is African Americans. Right. And I know the question that a lot of y'all have in your minds is, ""Should we do it?"" Yeah. Fuck yeah, we should do it. Listen, no matter what they say or how they make you feel, remember, this is your country, too. -It is incumbent upon us... to save our country. And you know what we have to do. This is a fuckin' election year. We gotta be serious. Every able-bodied African American must register for a legal firearm.

I don't want 'em, but I feel like I need 'em. Don't forget where I live. I live in Ohio. And anyone that knows anything about Ohio knows that even the word ""Ohio"" is an old Native American word. It means, literally, uh, ""land of poor white people."" And I don't know what's going on down here, but in my experience, uh, poor white people love, and, I mean, they fucking love... heroin. They can't seem to get enough of it. I didn't know what I was looking at at first. I was driving, like, ""Why are all these white people so sleepy out here?"" It's really bad. Matter of fact, I was coming out of the nightclub the other night in Dayton, and I had parked my car in the alley, and no one was out. I didn't have no bodyguards or nothing. I was home. I figured everything was fine. And as soon as I open my car door, all by myself, suddenly, uh, one of these heroin-addicted whites just pops out of a trash can. It scared the shit out of me. I screamed. ""Aah!"" And then, I realized it was a woman. She was fucked up. She was like... ""Hey, man. Hey, man. Relax, okay? I'm sick, all right? I need some drugs, man. Please?

It's ruining lives, it's... destroying families. Sadly, you know what it reminds me of? Seeing it? Reminds me of us. These white folks look exactly like us during the crack epidemic. You know, it's really crazy to see. And all this shit they talk about on the news about how divided the nation is, I don't believe it. I feel like, nowadays, we're gettin' a real good look at each other. It's wild, because I even have insight into how the white community must've felt watching the black community go through the scourge of crack... because I don't care either. ""Hang in there, Whites. Just say no. What's so hard about that?"" Remember when y'all said that to us? But it's okay. There's no grudges. Now you finally got it right. Once it started happening to your kids, you realize it's a health crisis. These people are sick. They are not criminals. They are sick. Be that as it may, I'm armed to the teeth."

Remember, though, I'd moved to a farm and I was sittin' on the porch, and I see a white dude walking across my property, entitled, like he's supposed to be there. He had a rifle over his shoulder, too. Ain't that a bitch? I said, ""What the fuck is this guy doing on my property?"" I was mad as shit, but I was unarmed. So, I ended up just waving to this motherfucker like a bitch. I was just, like... And as soon as he got far enough away, I ran to my car and sped to Kmart."
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,29,"This is in a rural white area. And remember, I was nervous, 'cause the guy was on my property, I'm black, and I was sweating. You know what I mean? And I ran to the gun counter. Black and sweaty, sweating and black, and I looked up and I was like... I looked like a slave or something. I said, ""I need a gun. Immediately."" Like that. Just like that. The guy didn't ask no questions, he just... grabbed a 12-gauge shotgun, handed it to me. I'd never even held a gun before. I'm like... ""Well, I need... I need some bullets, too."" And the guy reached under the counter, put two boxes of shells on the counter. He said, ""All right, buddy. Which box do you want?"" I didn't know. One box had a picture of some ducks on it. The other box had a picture of some deer. I said, ""Well, what's that box with them ducks?"" He said, ""Oh, that there's bird shot."" And then he goes just like this, I'm not exaggerating, he goes, ""That won't kill a man."" He said, ""It'll just pepper him up nicely."" I said, ""What the fuck? Pepper?"" "
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,30,"You know what it means to pepper a motherfucker up? It means that when the shell explodes, hot BBs will shoot out of the barrel of the gun, not killing a motherfucker, but penetrating their skin and shallow flesh. Boy, that's gotta hurt. Hot BBs? ""Aah! Aaaah!"" Remember when Dick Cheney shot a motherfucker in the face and he lived? That was bird shot. I said, ""Well, what's that box with the deer on it?"" He goes, ""Oh, that there is buckshot. That'll put a hole in a goddamn truck if you wanted to. So, which box do you want?"" And he picked the one with the deer up and shook it. I thought he was trying to trick me. I was like, ""Do you have a box, uh, with a picture of a white dude trespassing on it? ‘Cause... ....that's exactly the strength I'm looking for. But I didn't know that if you're defending your home with a shotgun, the formula dictates that you're supposed to buy both boxes. This was not a formula that I was familiar with. It goes like this: there's six shots in a 12-gauge shotgun. So when you load the gun, you load it like this. First shot, bird shot. Next shot, buckshot. Bird shot, and then after that, gun's Jamaican. Buckshot, buckshot, buckshot. But you gotta picture it."
2019,Sticks & Stones,Dave Chappelle,"Atlanta, GA",M,8.5,9,22204,8.1,8.4,1400,13912,31,"Okay, like, say I'm in bed and I'm sleepin', and suddenly, my wife wakes me up. ""David. David, wake up!"" And I'm like, ""Uh, oh. Look who's come around."" And I pull my dick over the top of my pajamas. And she's says, ""No, I hear somethin'."" I go, ""Oh, this bitch."" So I get up out of bed... Uh, grab the gun. I say, ""Wait here, baby. I'll go check it out. Just lock the door behind me."" Oh, my God, she's right. Right there in the kitchen is a heroin-addicted white and... he's digging through the change jar by the door. ""I work really hard for that change. I gotta do something."" So, first, I rack the shotgun. ""Hey, motherfucker!"" Click-clack. That's a test. That click-clack sound will stop a rational human being in their tracks. But, sure enough, this person is not rational. They're sick on drugs. They're digging in the change. I gotta act fast. This nigga's almost got $1.50. ""I warned you."" Bird shot! And there it goes. Hot BB's will permeate his yellow heroin skin. Remember, I'm not killing him, I'm just ""peppering him up nice."" He lets out a heroin scream. No! And that should be the end of it. But... Uh-oh. I miscalculated. While he's on the ground screaming, I notice that his teeth are horribly miscolored. That's not heroin at all, is it? That's crystal meth. He pops right back up, unscathed. Time for the heavy stuff. Clack-clack. Buckshot! And then, if he got a friend with him, I got one more bird shot left. And I repeat the cycle. After that nigga, it's slugs for everybody. And I'll be in a kitchen full of dying heroin addicts, saying stupid heroin last words. ""You shot me, bro."" ""Oh, it hurts, man. It hurts. Ah.""

Don't ever forget what happened to that French actor. You know who I'm talking about. Jussie Smollett, he's a very French... A very famous French actor. Y'all never heard of Jussie Smollett? Jussie Smollett is an actor from France. A-And he became famous on a show called Empire. And one night, he was in Chicago late at night, and was the victim... He was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack. You see, Jussie Smollett is... gay, and he is black, not just French. Oh, it was a crazy story. Apparently, when he's walking down the street late at night, two white men came out of the shadows, uh... with MAGA hats on and beat him up. Tied a rope around his neck, called him all kinds of niggasand... and... put some bleach on him and ran off into the night. This shit was, like, international news. And everybody was furious, especially in Hollywood. It's all over everybody's Twitter feed and Instagram page. ""Justice for Jussie"" and all this shit. The whole country was up in arms. We was talking about it all the time on the news, and... and, for some reason, uh, African Americans, we were like oddly quiet. We were so quiet about this shit that the gay community started accusing the African American community of being homophobic for not supporting him. But what they didn't understand is that we were supporting him with our silence. Because we understood that this nigga was clearly lying. None of these details added up at all. He said he's walking down the street in Chicago and-and, uh, white dudes come up to him and say, ""Hey, man, aren't you that faggot nigger from Empire?"" What the fuck? Does that sound like how white people talk? I know white people. They don't talk like that. ""Are you that faggot nigger from Empire?"" They would never say that. It sounds like something... that I would say. If you're racist and homophobic, you don't even know who this nigga is. You can't watch Empire."

Sandwiches? That's when the men approached you? Did you see them? Do you have any– Okay, what did they have on? MAGA hats? MAGA hats on in Chicago? Excuse me, one second, Mr. Smollett. Frank, come here for a second. Find out where Kanye West was last night."" Such a fucking outrageous story. He said they put a rope around his neck. Has anyone here ever been to Chicago? Yes! All right. All right, so you've been there. Now, tell me, how much rope do you remember seeing? Who the fuck is carrying rope?

I was talking all kinds of shit. Now, I didn't know that there was a journalist in the audience. And unfortunately for me, that motherfucker... took impeccable notes. He told everybody everything I said. He was even puttin' the jokes in the headline. The headline said, ""Dave Chappelle Says He Wants To Smash A Dollhouse Over Jussie Smollett's Head."" I thought for sure when I read that headline, I said, ""Well, that's it for me. I'm canceled."" But lucky for me, that very same day, the Chicago police caught the motherfuckers that actually did it, and, hilariously, they were both, uh, Nigerian.

Everything else is the same. I know what it's like to have a cold house. I wasn't allowed to touch the thermostat growing up without asking my father, and it would be fuckin' freezing in the house.

""I got all three of my outfits on, nigga. Will you look at me? I'm freezing up here."" And he said, ""Just don't think about how cold you are, David."" And I said this. I didn't say it to him, but I said it in front of him so he could hear. I said, ""I fuckin' hate being poor."" And my dad got really upset. He didn't scream or howl. That wasn't his way. He just threw his newspaper on the floor, and he said, ""David, David, David. You are not poor."" He said, ""Poor is a mentality."" He said, ""It's a mentality that very few people ever recover from.

There's a long line of kids waiting behind me while I'm at the door, trying to count out 300 pennies to get inside. I will never forget this shit as long as I fuckin' live. Oh, man, you know.

No dudes, though. But tell me if I'm right about this. Well, just agree, 'cause this is for my TV special. Like, those dudes will beat you to death with a sack of batteries, but they get their eyebrows waxed. You know the kind of guy I'm talking about? I was at a Met game... thank you. And... it was Mets, Phillies, and I'm sitting behind third base. And these huge Philly meatheads are heckling David Wright. They're like, ""You suck, Wright. You're the worst. We hate you"".

Like, look at the shirts you guys are wearing. Every one of you that I can see, you could have worn that when you were a toddler on picture day. Every one. No difference. Check it out. But look at the beautiful girls you're with. Look at... it's so much work for us. It takes me 90 minutes to look this mediocre. 90 minutes. Tonight it took eight hours, okay? I slept sitting up. I slept like this. It's so much work. Oh, we're like clowns. We are circus freaks, women, we are. We... we put paint on our faces like warriors. We're... I'm wearing stilts. We wear stilts. We wear heels all night. And we put a string in our buttholes, just... ""Ah... am I pretty?"" We wear jewelry, shiny shit... ""Look over here. Follow me to the altar"". "

I work in Vegas a lot. That doesn't sound awesome. But I do stand-up in Vegas a lot, and I see these packs of young girls that still have the energy, you know? Just a pack of girls all wearing tube dresses, right? And just... the heels they can't handle. They have to hold each other and do, like, Wizard of Oz walk, chain gang kind of... They all look identical. It looks like a whore computer just shot out a prototype, and they just started walking. ""Tonight, tonight's the night, you guys"". I like seeing them at the end of the night, you know, like it didn't work out. They're carrying their heels. They're crying their makeup off. It looks like they're melting.

You think it just shows up like that to the event? It doesn't. Every night it's like getting it ready for its first quinceañera, believe me. Gets an updo, it cries. It's a lot of work. It didn't used to be work. I know that from watching vintage porn. It was no work. Zero. I even... I remember my mom bottomless when I was a kid. And it was just... poof! It looked like the black smoke monster from Lost was just following her. It's like, ""Is Mom being swarmed by bees? ""What is... ""Is that a tumbleweed? We're not even in the West"". And then something happened. I don't know. Like, 10, 15 years ago, all the dudes got together and had, like, a meeting. Like a fantasy football draft about our privates. They were like, ""We can't get in there. ""It's like Vietnam trying to... What do we do?"" And then they just came to us, and they were just like, ""Ladies, would you mind looking like babies again?"" And we were like... ""Like, what do you mean? Just clean up the sides a little bit or..."" ""The whole enchilada"". And we were like, ""Yeah, that's not super weird"". So now we go, we get it done."

That's not how it goes down, no. We get it done. We have to go see a woman, usually from a third-world country. It's never from, like... like, it's never me that comes and gets you from the waiting room. Like, I'll never be like, ""Hi, I'm Ashley. I'm here to take care of your pussy"". Like, no. ""Pussy!"" No, it's not... that's not how it goes. Like, the chick who does it to me in New York, I think she's from, like, the killing fields of Cambodia. Like, this poor woman... I can tell, like, she has seen some shit, you know? She has been through it, and she was, like, a doctor there. And now she does this, and she hates me. And she doesn't even hide it. I walk in, she's like, ""Ugh"". I'm like, ""Sorry"". But she should, she should hate me because I'm like... we're the worst, white, entitled girls. I walk in chewing gum, I'm on my phone. I'm just like... I'm like, ""Don't get any wax on my new UGGs. What?"" She's like, ""My parents were murdered in front of me"". I'm like, ""I'm on the phone. What?"" ""It's about True Blood.

And it's not cool. It's the worst thing you'll ever see in your life. It's red. It looks angry. It looks like an old man frowning. Just, ""No!"" ""Visit me!"" ""Birds!"" I don't know.

But in every group of girlfriends, there's always, like, one that's the sluttiest, you know? If you don't have that friend, you're that friend. Let's be real. And it wasn't me in my group of friends. Shocker was my nickname. But, no, in my group of friends... in my... the sluttiest of us was this girl Katie. And... we didn't judge her for that. But she... she wouldn't own it. Like as soon as she would have a boyfriend, she'd start acting like Mother Teresa, you know? She'd, like, walk different. She talked differently. Like, I remember one time she walked over with her new boyfriend, she was like, ""Adam and I are thrilled you could join us for brunch"". I was like, ""I've helped you get cum out of your hair"". ""Remember, we tried using peanut butter 'cause we're stupid, remember?"" We didn't talk about that at brunch with Adam."

Like, these girls, they were all, like, very Stepford wife, you know? They all, like, wore, like, pastel cashmere cardigans and pearls and Burberry, like, tampons. And they all spoke like this, like almost in a whisper. Like, they all were... everybody just walked around whispering to each other. Like, ""Oh, I guess we were just born ""with different vocal cords 'cause I was raised better. Do you ski?"" So I'm at this party, and I'm, like, mainlining chardonnay, trying to remember fun. Just like, ""Why?"" So one of the girls was like, ""Let's play a game"". And I'm like, ""Suicide pact? I'll go first. This party's the worst"". And she goes, ""No, let's all go around and admit something"". And I'm like, ""Oh, no"". So these girls are going around. They are... the shit they're admitting is so boring. I can't... like, one girl was like, ""Once, I forgot to let the dog out all day!"" And they were all like, ""No!"" I'm like, ""Is this happening right now?"" So the girl that goes right before me, Bridget, the worst human I've ever met. I hope she sees this. That's how bad of a person she is. Like, Bridget, I hope you're watching this. But she wouldn't. She wouldn't be up this late. She spoke the softest. You had to, like, lean in and squint and read her lips, 'cause she just...

They're all looking at her like, ""Bridget! You should be asleep"". ""Bridget, it's night. Carbs? Come on"". So then it's my turn, and... I don't look at my friend Katie. I just feel her just glaring at me, just like, ""Don't be yourself right now, bitch! This is my new life"". And so I'm like, ""Okay... first of all, Bridget, thank you for being so brave"". ""I'll admit this. ""It's kind of like your ice cream thing. ""One time I let a cab driver finger me"". And Katie's like, ""That's not how you play, Amy"".

You guys all look like you're from this neighborhood. So... Here's how I wound up here. Okay? Let me just catch you up. My two front teeth didn't fall out until I was in fifth grade. Which is late. And that same week, I got my period. Which is early! So I was just like this jack-o'-lantern with tits walking around, like... Trick or treat. I was like Pinocchio transitioning to a donkey. I was like, ""Hee-haw!"" And I had one of those really cool moms who told me, ""You don't need to shave above your knee, just... here down."" So here up, I was just a werewolf, just...

And the male romantic lead is... Kevin James. Um... Oh, my God, I know. Is it wet in here, ladies, or is it us? The real King James. And, uh... And Kevin James is dating a beautiful, blonde skeleton. And... And he's sad because sometimes she's mean to him. And then... the girl who is in love with him, who he doesn't notice, who's been there all along, waiting in the wings, is Rosario Dawson... arguably the most fuckable actress ever. Rosario Dawson is just, like, working at the zoo, just, like, sweeping up koala shit. Like, ""Please fuck me, Kevin James."" ""Why won't Kevin James give me his dick?"" And he's like, ""Ew, you're wearing khakis, never."" Like, that movie's about talking animals. There is a beaver and a penguin that are friends and talk about opening a bed and breakfast. But that's not the most unrealistic part of that movie. It's Rosario pretending– She should get an Oscar for that fucking movie. Let's see Meryl do that. I dare you, Meryl.

Like, I mean, week one, doesn't even have a sign or a dog yet, you know, just, like... just got out there. ""Yes,"" I thought. ""Yes, that's fine."" Some family members... like a cousin. Like... Not like a cousin you grew up playing with, like just one that you see at funerals, like that kind of a distance. He could go down on me. Any girl, any girl. I mean, I could never go down on a girl, though. I couldn't do it. If a pussy were ever in front of me and it was, like, go time, it would be like I was, like, trying to jump into Double Dutch.

I'm like, ""Do you have to be, like, the point guard to get a merlot? This is horrible."" But I go to the game and I was like, ""This is a fancy event.

I was really kind of feeling myself, you know? I just walk in and I'm like, ""Here I am. Like, feast your eyes,"" and then the first person I saw was literally Kate Upton.

Like, ""Do your clown thing."" And I'm like, ""I don't want to."" But... And funny girls do not want anything to do with beautiful girls. And you guys are like, ""Amy, but you're both."" Oh, my God, thank you guys for all thinking that. All of you, every one of you, every single one of you, and all my ex-boyfriends. Oh, my God. Like, you can have it all. Um... I don't like talking to really hot people. I'm very grossed out being around someone gorgeous. But my friend talked to her and he was like, ""She was actually really funny,"" and I was like, ""Fuck you."" No way. There's no way. We just have such low expectations for hot– for hot people to be anything. I'm like, ""You were probably blown away she wasn't just sitting there playing with her tits and drooling Like...

I was like, ""Oh, when's her hour special coming out on HBO? What a great..."" Fuck you. Wouldn't that have gone so different if it were like just a normal-looking girl?

Different outfits all night. Just... And they're so nervous. And you're like, ""Why are they so nervous? Like, they're just walking."" ""Oh, this outfit. What is it?"" But it's because at the end of the night, they make them do this thing, it's so fucked up. They dim the lights, and they change the music, and they make these poor girls answer one question. Just one. They're just like– The hosts are very patient with them. They're like, ""Okay, look, ladies, ""you knew this was coming. You're gonna have to form a sentence."" And they can't believe they have to– They're all holding each other and weeping. Like, ""No! Words!"" And they can't do it. And you know they've been coached. Like, just say ""education"" and get the fuck out of there. And they can't. They can't do it. The one who wins, the one they crown the winner is just the one that doesn't, like, blurt out the N-word.

But you know they're thinking, ""You're not gonna be buried with the rest of us, okay?"" I want them to do a ""Where Are They Now?"" with people who blew it on ""Family Feud.""

But... In your 30s, you walk past and you're like, ""What about this, huh?"" My skirt's, like, over my head. I'm like... ""Aah!"" They're like, ""We're eating."" I'm like... ""Aah!"" That shit changes. It does. Who here is in their 40s? What about 30s? 20s? Do you hear that hope? Remember? Do you remember 20s hope? Do you? I kinda do.

In your 20s, you're so corrupt with power, especially if you're in love in your 20s. Remember 20s love? You're just so arrogant. You're like, ""We're so lucky we found each other. What are all these sad songs about?"" I think of 20s love the same as the tsunami, because I read that in the tsunami, the tide was way in, so, fish were flopping around the shore and people were, like, psyched. They were gathering them with baskets. Like, ""I can't believe my luck. Look at all these fish!"" That's, like, 20s love. You're like, ""For me and me!"" And then you're like, ""Oh, fuck!""

It's like taking six Xanax. Like, why are you wasting my time? Small popcorn. And then the cashier is like, ""For $15, you can get one more handful,"" and I'm like, ""That sounds like a great deal. We'll take it."" You sit in there and you're supposed to act like you're not thinking about the popcorn and you're just watching the movie, like, ""Oh, I forgot that we even had popcorn.""

Um, you can't. And not just 'cause I'm not totally out of the woods with this UTI, but also... I am not on any dating sites. Like, the only app I have on my phone like that is Foodspotting, which is like Tinder but for food. So, it lets you know about foods in your area. Uh... Like the other day I was, like, eyeing up, like, this one scone and it was under a mile away, I was like, ""Is this a coincidence? Like, I don't–"" It's like, ""Yes."" And then, uh... I'm like, ""Should I go?"" and my friends are like, ""Go! Like, go! See!"" and I'm like, ""Okay.""

And... What do you want? And he wound up being a, like, an insane alcoholic and that's my thing. Uh... I feel like in most relationships, there's, like, one alcoholic, and then, like, one person who's sad about it, and I wanted to be, like, the fun one. So, I called my mom, um, because nothing makes her happier than me being alone, and she's like, ""Oh, my God, will I be seeing you more?"" Um... and I'm like, ""Yes, Mom,"" and she starts giving me advice. She's like, ""Am, you need to love like you've never been hurt,"" and I'm like, ""Are you reading off of a bumper sticker right now?"" Like... she's like, ""Dance like no one's watching."" Like, dance like a couple of people are watching. Right? Even if you're alone, maybe hold it together. Cross the street like no cars– What? I was thinking about this last night and I was having a little, um, wine and... weed and an Ambien, um... or as I call it, tucking myself in. Um... Good night, moon. And... I... I am a good person. I swear to you. Like, I'm very old-school. I think the guy should always pay on the first date for sex and... I'm a romantic. I'm labeled a sex comic. Like, that's in interviews. People are always like, ""So you– you talk about sex,"" and I'm like... I think it's just 'cause I'm a girl. I feel like a guy could get up here and literally pull his dick out and everybody would be like, ""He's a thinker."" But... Right? It's true.

Like, if that provides you with discomfort, you're just looking at it the wrong way. We need to be nicer about cum. We really do. Cum gives us life, you know? Gandhi was cum. Oprah– cum. Oprah could have wound up all over somebody's tits, but no... we got Oprah. Thank you, cum. And yes, it is sticky and gross and no one ever wants it in their mouth ever, ever, ever, but... we need to change how we're thinking about it. It's not a wonderfully regal moment as a woman when you take a load. Um... when someone cums in you, you're not like, ""We can do it. I'm glad I leaned in."" It's not– But it's a fact of life. All the greatest women have dealt with it, okay? Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Diane Sawyer. Michelle Obama, who I love, like the rest of us, probably once a week has to carefully walk to the bathroom. Just squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish. It's the White House. It's probably a long hallway. Squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish.

Which is why I'm dressed like this. Uh... but... And then, you know, I've dated guys where I always have to initiate and that's embarrassing. It's because I used to fuck really dumb guys and I miss that so very, very much. Dumb guys really pound you... 'cause they're dumb. I love men, though. I really do. I was on the subway the other day and I heard these two guys having this conversation. So there's two of them. They're standing on the subway and they're like...

I love– There– there's the dolphin. That's where the guy tries to put it in the girl's butt and she goes, ""Ehh-ehh, ehh-ehh."" That's, like, a fun family one.

What is this? What's the claw? That's how disgusted we are with ourselves. ""Does anyone have a tampon?"" And I notice myself do it. I was in a gym locker room. Thank you. And... And there were a bunch of women in there, and I... And this woman across the locker room with so much confidence was like, ""Oh, yeah, I do. What size?"" And, like, obviously, I know there are different sizes of tampons, but I've never been confronted... ...with that question before, you know? She's like, ""Yeah, what's the circumference of your pussy hole? Grande or venti? What are we plugging, bitch? I've got Pilates. What is it?"" Then all the other women in the locker room kinda lean in to hear... ...my answer, you know? I'm just like... ""I don't know. Do you have, like, a... super Grand Canyon? I don't know. Just throw me a futon mattress. I'll just kind of squat over it."""

It just grows over the years. I know because, I mean, when I was younger, I could put a Tic Tac in there and then just walk around all day. At night, I swear it would still be in the same place, just... Whoop! Now... if I have a yeast infection, which I do... and I try to put one of those Monistat suppositories in, it just falls right on the floor. Whoop! Be careful. They're very slippery. I do.

It's like this little cup you store in the back of your vagina, and it collects... and at the end of the day, you pull it out and you kinda Kill Bill. Just kind of... No! It's a lot. It's too much for me. I respect you if you can handle the DivaCup. Such a confident name. ""I'm a Diva."" No. It's more exciting than the DivaCup. It's a new invention called THINX. Yes.

I did not understand that the whole price you have to pay for staying at home is that you've gotta be a mom. Oh, and that's a job. It's a wack-ass job. You get no 401K, no co-workers. You're just in solitary confinement all day long with this human Tamagotchi... That don't got no reset button, so the stakes are extremely high.

With a human baby, you just have to guess and check your intuition by sniffing its ass... Twenty-six times a day. And you can't phone it in and sniff it from afar. You really gotta flip the baby over, plant your face in the baby's ass and give it a good yoga inhale with your mouth and everything, because the inside of your nose has been singed from all the poo-poo smelling."

Giving birth ain't nothing compared to breastfeeding! Breastfeeding is brutal. It is chronic physical torture. I thought it was supposed to be this beautiful bonding ceremony, where I would feel like I was sitting on a lily pad in a meadow and bunnies would gather at my feet while the fat Hawaiian man version of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" would play. No! It's not like that at all! Breastfeeding is this savage ritual that just reminds you that your body is a cafeteria now! It don't belong to you no more. When my baby girl would get hungry, she'd yank my nipple back and forth like that bear fucking up Leonardo DiCaprio in The Revenant. It's frightening. I saw that movie, and my nipples were like, ""I feel you, Leo!"""

You can spin DVDs on them, that's how Command hook-like they are. But apparently, you have to get the baby to latch on at a very specific angle. You gotta tilt their head and do geometry to get them on properly. And it's very stressful, because when they're hungry and they're crying, it makes your hormones spray milk all over their face and their neck, which then become very slippery and hard to grip, and then you gotta slam them on at just the right time. And every time I would do it, it was like parallel parking. I don't know how I did it! It's a mystery. I was never properly trained, but I just did it. I just went back and forth, and back and forth, and back and forth, until all these very concerned strangers start gathering outside of my car.

Come on, Mom, you know what it is. Local, organic, free-range, farm-to-mouth milk squirting outta my titties."" It was squirting out of like 15 holes in each titty, like the Bellagio fountain, just, ""Woo. Woo, woo, woo. Woo, woo, woo."" For free! My body was a food factory.

People kept on asking me, ""Ali, how did you get so skinny after the baby?"" She sucked the life outta me! As it turns out, breastfeeding is not free because you have to buy all of these pillows and pumps to support your breastfeeding, and then you might get a clogged duct. That's when you get like a traffic jam kidney stone in your titty, and then you have to call a lactation consultant. A lactation consultant is a white NPR listener with dreadlocks, Named Indigo, That you have to pay $200 to rush over to your house and Roto-Rooter your titty.

You can't get that shit on Amazon or anything, so you gotta snatch that shit every day. It's made out of the same material that they package fancy Korean pears in. It's very Dac Biet, okay? Number one extra large Dac Biet hospital underwear. For three months, I was walking around my house with a top knot, giant diaper, nipples bleeding. Like a defeated sumo wrestler."

And then I was like, ""Cut it out."" The nurse was like, ""Keep going."" I was like, ""Bitch, I said cut it out. ♪ Your price is way too high You need to cut it ♪ ♪ Cut it, cut it, you need to cut it♪ The nurse was not a big hip hop fan, so... She did not appreciate that or my Dave Coulier reference. Look, a C-section is no joke, okay? It is major surgery. But it's very fast. They put the anesthesia in your back, and then they put up this curtain so that your husband can only see your human side and not your cadaver side. And then ten minutes later, they hold the baby above the curtain like bloody Simba and it's over. I was like, ""What the fuck did I do all that pushing for when there was this perfectly good emergency exit?"""

The baby's head kept on going in and out, and in and out, and in and out. And then she still had to have an emergency C-section. Before that shit went down, my friend was the kindest, most polite, dainty lady, who would never burp in front of anybody. After that shit went down, she became the most bitter, nasty, raw-ass bitch I have ever met in my life! I went to her house to pay her a visit shortly after, she opens the door, ""Look at my pussy, Ali. Look at this shit! Look at this!"" No, ""Hello, Ali. Welcome. Come meet my beautiful new baby."" No, just, ""Come on, you look at this shit! ""You look at what happened to me!"" Just with the door open, in front of the entire cul-de-sac to see, ""Come on!"" And her pussy looked crazy! It looked cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs! "

In the process of giving birth to one baby girl, my friend became two dudes. You could French braid that shit. It was like a Star Wars monster. I mean, women, we're not accustomed to seeing each other's pussies in the first place. It's not like men at the urinal where you're like, ""Hey, what's up, dude? What's going on?"" holding your dicks in your hands in front of each other. We're never just like going to the bathroom, ""What's up, girl?"" holding our pussies, just casual, ""I like your manicure."" I told her that she had turned into two dudes. And she started laughing. But then she started to get also extremely upset. And she was like, ""Please, do not make me laugh! Do not make me laugh!"" And then with one hand, she had to grab a pillow, and press it against her C-section scar. And then with the other hand, she had to... pinch the dicks together... To make sure that... the carne asada wouldn't fall out of the taco, and become nachos on the floor."

I told her all of that too, and she started laughing more. And, you know, she was like, she was pinching and she was pressing, and repressing the laughter and it got to be too much, and then all of this gas gurgled up in her system, and she let out this fat-ass queef that dried out my eyeballs.

And she's like, ""That's yours."" And you're like, ""Oh my God, that's mine?"" I did not even feel it go out. The catheter, it just carries it out.

Men never get asked that question... because they don't. They just neglect the child for like 90% of the day, and that's perfectly socially acceptable, but the standards for dads are so low that they get so much praise for doing so little. My husband occasionally changes diapers, and when people hear that, ""Oh my God,"" confetti everywhere! ""I cannot believe that your husband changes diapers! What a doting modern father. Lucky you!"" When my baby girl was first born, I would do skin-on-skin contact every day to bond with her. She shit on my chest. Where's my confetti at? I'll tell you how I balance family and career, real talk? I have a nanny. That's it, that's the answer. Yes, it's very unlikable and unpopular to broadcast that because not everybody can afford a nanny. It's super expensive. It's expensive for me and my husband, so the both of us, we have to hustle, we have to work very hard to not take care of our child ourselves. I'm all about putting the oxygen mask on myself before I put it on my baby. I like that protocol. I like that philosophy very much. When the stewardess tells me to make sure to do that, I'm always like, ""Yeah, I was gonna do that. I got no problem with that."""

I want to be Mexican in my next life. Don't nobody have more fun than Mexicans. I used to live at Crenshaw and Pico, yes, if you don't know, Crenshaw and Pico is this magical corner in the hood of Los Angeles where Guadalajara meets Korea... And the Mexicans and the Koreans are in constant racial warfare, and their weapons are loud music versus frowning. Mexicans know how to prioritize family and fun. They take their kids to Disneyland all the time. And now to accommodate, there is all of this Spanish at Disneyland. Every ride begins with, ""Ladies and gentlemen, for your safety please keep your arms and hands inside the vehicle at all times. Damas y caballeros, por favor mantengan las manos y los Brazos dentro Del coche, and please do not smoke... Because it is gross and dangerous, okay? And employees must wash hands before returning to work. Okay, be careful. Be very careful. Cos tongue taco, son of a bitch, apple! ♪ Late at night When all the world is sleeping ♪ Yes, that's how Mexican Disneyland has gotten, they play Selena on Pirates of the Caribbean.

If you are hiring a 25-year-old pretty young thing to be your nanny, you a dumb-ass. Do you not read People magazine? You don't know what's up? That's inviting a marriage grenade into your home. When you have a newborn baby, your marriage is very weak because you're both stressed out, you look like shit 'cause you don't shower no more, you're resentful of each other, whose idea was it to bring this new roommate into the world? Your marriage is very vulnerable and easy for an outsider to invade and colonize. If we had hired a 25-year-old man, who was... not ugly... Great with my daughter and said yes immediately to every chore I asked him to do with a positive attitude, Oh, you best believe that I would eat the shit out of his butthole. Every day. Every day would be an all-day nanny butthole buffet. I don't care if his 25 year old butt cheeks got all nervous and clenched up and closed on my face like elevator doors, I would get in there and...

My older sister is an unemployed lesbian who lives on my mother's property. So I can do whatever I want. Yeah. Whatever I want!

I'm the same piece of shit that I always was before I became a mom, now just with more responsibility, and I'm barely rising to the occasion. And I'm not ashamed, I'm not going to hide that I was very sexually active in my twenties. You know why? Because everybody knows the secret now that when a woman sleeps with a man right away, it's not because we don't respect ourselves, it's because we don't respect you. We don't see you as marriage material. That's why we let your dick inside so fast. By letting you in, we're really kicking you out of our future. ""Bye, Felicia, be on your merry little way."" We're just trying to have fun, we're not trying to trap your ass."

I'm gonna repeat that shit to my daughter over and over and over again. Do not fall for that trap. I fell for that shit once, fell in love and into a semi long-term relationship with a man who kept on wanting to wait to have sex, and I assumed it was because he thought I was so special, and amazing, and worth waiting for... He was hiding something! Months later he finally agrees to get busy and unveils this tiny mess of a thing that wouldn't even reach your molars. It was a black dude. Creepy, right? Like seeing a homeless Asian person, ""What happened to you?"" ""Oh my God, who are your parents? Truly!"" It was a black dude, and I told all my black friends about it, and they were like, ""Where the fuck is he at? We need to assassinate him right now before he further threatens to tarnish our sacred reputation!"" It was the first and last time I had ever seen an actual micropenis. And my honest first reaction when I saw it was... ""Oh, my God, are you okay? What happened, did you just get hit by a bus? Did a car outside just like sideswipe your dick off, and now is your dick rolling around on the street like a severed snake head? And should we get a mason jar and just scoop it up, and bring you both to the hospital to have you sewed back together? Wait a minute. Wait a minute... Is this some sort of Princess and the Frog test? Did a witch curse you a long time ago as punishment for calling her ugly?

And when I was warming up to tape my very first stand-up comedy special I did four shows in my hometown, San Francisco. And I was so excited, I was super pumped. And then I couldn't sell out all the tickets, so they had to put half of them up on Groupon. I know a lot of you are having a Chinese heart attack right now. ""Oh my God... You mean to tell me I could've seen this bitch a year ago for $10?"" Look, I love Groupon, okay? But it was so depressing and demoralizing to see my face and my picture next to... whale watching tours, Teeth whitening services, and discontinued dildos on clearance. I was like, ""This is sad."" And then fast forward to last year, my Netflix special Baby Cobra premiered Mother's Day weekend. And it was crazy, nothing like that had ever happened to me before. All of a sudden scalpers were charging up to $1,000 a ticket to see me headline live. Over 300 people dressed up as me while I was pregnant in that striped dress for Halloween. And I was so happy. Until I realized that I have no interest in being famous. I don't. All I ever wanted was more money for less effort. I just wanna collect checks in my pajamas. Play a piece of tofu in a Pixar movie or something. Yeah, come on, you see it, the tofu's got glasses, a lot of attitude, sings some song about the joy of soy with Justin Timberlake. My arch nemesis can be a piece of beef played by Idris Elba, Named Stringer Beef or something. I'm not even that famous and already I hate it. I hate it so much. It's a burden!

Well, my mom is very concerned that he's going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man that would leave a woman who makes more money, is the kind of man that doesn't like free money. ""Oh, but Ali, he doesn't feel small?"" He's too busy living large on my new salary! ""Oh. Oh... Oh, but Ali, doesn't he feel like you took something away from him?"" Oh, do you mean like the pressure to provide?

So much so, that before we got married, his family made me sign a prenup. It's true, and now if we get divorced, their son is fucked. No more sashimi on a Tuesday! No more fancy Japanese toilet bidet where water comes out and Hello Kitty sings the song until your butthole's fresh and clean. Go back to drinking flat water, bitch! It is said that if you earn more in the relationship, then you are the breadwinner. I think my husband's the real breadwinner, because he won a bread machine. Being a woman and the breadwinner is not all that, okay? Because you get insecure, you do, about having too much power, so then you overcompensate in the marriage by letting the husband have a say and... And then on top of that, you know, I get very insecure as being seen as like an ice cold, workaholic mom, so then I'm the main caregiver of our daughter, too. And I'm exhausted! I'm overwhelmed!"

I fart in my husband. ‘Cause we are best friends.

Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just... ""I slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!"""

I'm– I'm 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that... is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker's lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. ""Uh, mmm."" They watch Property Brothers, scratch, ""What's crackin'? Mmm."" Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, ""When can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to..."" ""...smell my fingers?"" Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, 'cause you gotta check that it's all good in the hood. If it's too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD."

You guys doin' a lot of fuckin'?"" No, dude. That's– That's shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in– When you're in your 30s, and you've been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin'. It tells you when it's Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, ""We're not fuckin'. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it's like, ‘Release the Kraken!'"" And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um... yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn't even have sex, 'cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I'd be like, ""OK, it's go time,"" and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately.

When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it's not because they're in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it's because they're literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn't have to see the expression on my face that says, ""Please, hurry the fuck up."" And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It's when they get that... that stupid-ass look on their face... ...where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just... And then, because we're hippies, I'd be like, ""Hey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?"" And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him... and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards... to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That's right. ‘Cause I don't wanna work anymore."

And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They're like, ""Oh, my God. That's so dark and terrible. I can't believe that."" I'm 33. Girl, when you're 33, you'll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It's super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn't feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom– She's from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, ""Uh, yeah. Where I'm from, that's like losing a pair of shoes. It's whatevs, OK?"" And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, ""Oh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you're having twins."" And I was like, ""No!"" And then she said, ""But what I don't see is a heartbeat."" And I was like, ""Yes!"" ""The Lord is mysterious!"" Don't feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I've picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won't let their husbands watch when they're going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, ""You look."" ""You watch the whole thing."" And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyoncé. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That's my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted."

They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, ""Ali, did you know that you're gonna poop on the table?"" I was like, ""Yeah, I look forward to it."" I'm all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can't wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you're in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that's enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That's the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn't even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. ""Hey, can you wash the dishes?"" ""No!"" ""Can you water the plants?"" ""I am not doing jack shit anymore.

And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor's appointments with me. ""Oh, my God. I can't believe he comes to all your doctor's appointments. He is so supportive."" Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I'm the star of the show. There's nothing for the camera to see if I'm not there. But he's the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I'm a bad mommy."

So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis... to keep him down so that he doesn't believe that he's worthy of another woman's affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don't tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn't know that. I didn't know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. Like, ""You, you. You owe me money, you."" My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I'm not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant.

Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he's the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron'd my ass. And now, if I don't work, we die. Why else do you think I'm performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I've been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody. Thank you."

I take a puff. Then I brush. Then I do my stretches. Then I type in my search words. Let me just say, my search words are not anything I would want to happen in real life. I don't know why they're my search words, but they are. A great man once said, ""The heart wants what it wants."" So my search words are: gangbang... would not want that to happen in real life; um, amateur... 'cause I don't like seeing, like, piercings and tattoos... it takes me out of it; cum... which I would not have thought you had to put ""cum."" I thought that was a given in pornography. You have to put ""cum."" If you don't, you might not get cum. If anything, I would think you'd put non-cum if you don't want cum. And then there's one more. Oh, high-fives. So... I put my iPhone... I lean it against my water on my nightstand. And... I think I'm maybe the only person that watched this video all the way till the end end end, like when the video freezes. It's, of course, a gangbang and, you know, basically ends with all the guys coming on the lady's face. And... I don't know why face was the quiet word there. All the men come on the lady's face.

There was this Jewish volunteer service that came by and they were visiting the Jewish patients, which is nice, but isn't that so, like, elitist? Like what, do they, like, banana around the non-Jewish patients? Like, ""None for you."" But my mother's last name is O'Hara. She married a John O'Hara. And she said, ""They visited me.

That water would then cascade down her ample bosom and, like, pike off of her '70s Jew bush... that was my water. And that's the thing, it was a happy memory. I associate it with happy. I don't know why. Like, it was my very own curly shower or something. Maybe because we didn't need words. You know, it wasn't like she was like, ""You get your water from my pubes,"" you know.

I mean, the man, like... He had quite a run. He was 33. 33 is young. If someone dies now at 33, it's terrible.

Traumatic things happened to all of us. We just don't realize it because there's no music informing us how to feel or what's gonna come up. There's no slow motion. It just happens in real time and then the next moment and the next moment. My sister used to babysit me when I was three. And she would... she would... okay, I used to think this was a heartbreaking story about me. It's a heartbreaking story about my sister Susie, because she was so, um... she was so starved for love, she was so needy for love. And she would come out and she'd say, ""Sarah, if I drink this orange juice, I'm gonna turn into a monster."" And I was so scared. I wish I had the foresight to say, ""Hey, how about don't even pour the orange juice?"" But I didn't. I didn't think that far ahead. I was three. And I'd go... ""Susie, no no!"" She'd go... whip open the laundry nook and put on this brown leather ski mask... which why the Silverman family needed a brown leather ski mask I still do not know. She puts it on and she like... I mean I thought I was going to die. I felt the feeling of I'm going to die when I was three. And then this is what's so heartbreaking, she'd go... ""I will only turn back into Susie if you hug me."" Like, I wish I had the wherewithal to be like, ""Suse, you want a hug? I'd love to hug you. Let's cut out the middleman where I shit my pants."" But instead I'm inching towards this monster I'm terrified of to hug it. Oh God, I'm sorry.'"

She would take the... that threw me for a loop. She'd take the biggest knife out of the kitchen drawer and be like, ""It's so funny. Like, I could kill you right now. Isn't that funny?"" She gets so upset when I bring this up. No, she's so sweet now. And she... it literally makes her cry when I bring this up, but thank God, umm... she doesn't have HBO. But she's like this liberal, hippy, feminist rabbi that lives in Israel now and she's got five kids and her oldest daughter is going to Brandeis next year, which is... only from Israel can going to Brandeis be a step down in Jewy-ness. I don't know if you're familiar with Brandeis. It's not technically a Jewish school, but I think the team mascot is a nose. If that helps you at all."

I wish it wasn't true, but... or I am happy for them and their new... boyfriends. I made that up. I'm sorry. I made that up. I thought of it and it made me giggle, and then I got really sad, and then I still needed to say it to you. I don't know what part of me needs to say to you that 9/11 widows give great handjobs. That's dark. That's something I'm gonna talk about in therapy. But I wanted to say it. I needed to say it to you, and so I built a frame around it that forced you to not be able to blame me for saying it. And... but you know what? I feel like you should take some of the blame. Honestly, because you decided to believe that the University of North Carolina would spend money on a study of, what? Trauma-based handjobs? That's crazy. You're crazy.

Rape, obviously the most heinous crime imaginable. Rape jokes are great. No, because they make a comic seem so edgy and so dangerous. And the truth is it's like the safest area to talk about in comedy, because who is gonna complain about a rape joke? I mean, I would say rape victims, but they're traditionally not complainers. I know. That's a tasteless joke about the fact that rape victims often don't report rape. I mean, the worst thing that could happen really is someone comes up to you after a show and is like, ""Look, I'm a victim of rape and I just wanna say I thought that joke was insensitive and inappropriate and totally my fault and I am so sorry."" Yeah! Right? Let's take back the night back. Oh God. I hope I don't have to say that, you know, no woman is asking to be raped. I actually do think there are some women who are asking to be motorboated."

He has got these beautiful big blue eyes floating over his big brown eyes and he, um... His breath, um... I've really really thought about this. His breath smells like if all the farts from all the different, like, cultures and nations in the world combine together... and then passed through my grandpa's teeth. And he was constipated and it's so heartbreaking. You know, when a dog gets constipated and they... you can tell because their little knees like quiver. They quiver. And he's pushing so hard and then, like, something broke through and his mouth made a shape I've never seen on a dog. I didn't know it was possible. It was like a perfect circle. Like, ""Ohh!"" And his little tiny rectum was bleeding... Awww. ...and I went to take a picture and I... for the vet. ""The vet""... is what I call Twitter. And... You know, when you take a picture, but it's video and you don't realize it? It was basically a picture, but it was like a second and a half and it had breath, ended with me going like, ""Urg."" He's great now. He shits like crazy. Only thing that keeps him from shitting in his pants is he... he... he doesn't wear pants. That's a terrible joke. If you do have a dog, here's a great game.

I don't even understand how, but when I was young it was like if somebody said it or if I read it somewhere or sometimes I would write it down and look at it... Now I'm just dead inside. Pussy, pussy. Who cares? I found a way to make ""pussy"" gross again. It's so simple. All you have to do is puff out your cheeks when you say it. Like, ""Puhssy."" Puhssy. Puhssy. Now say that becomes old hat, you can add some elements: um, a deadness in the eyes, a lisp. ""Puthy."" ""Hey, man, you wanna go out and look for some puthy?"" Puthy. Puthy. You look so confused. You don't know how to feel. Just like me when I first heard ""puthy."" If you're drunk and throw up on a man's penis mid-blowjob, you can save the moment if you can muster a ""ta-da."""

I'm at a show too. You're my show and that joke... is so fun to tell because, like, at the first juncture, the guys are like this, and the girls are like this. And then it just goes whoo!

That was far out, right? Everybody got deep. There was a time where you could fit a million of me on the head of a pin. There was a time where I lived in my dad's balls. That's the only life I knew. There was a time where I literally was choking on my dad's cum. I was five. No, I'm just kidding. That's disgusting. Erase. That's not part of that joke. I... It's just it went in my head and then I... I couldn't be alone with it. There was a time... my dad, Donny ""Schleppy"" Silverman, who does my taxes, who I Skype with every Saturday... there was a time where I literally exploded... out of the-guy-who- taught-me-to-ski's penis hole.

And I remember when he decided to run for president, I was like, ""I'm gonna work on that campaign."" And I did. And because I live in Los Angeles, I could go to this fundraiser out here that was just star-studded, like a who's-who. And you could walk... you know, he was just a senator at the time, so you could walk right up to him and pet him and I did. I wanted to think of something smart to say or a question to ask and I was like... ""Senator Obama, when you were a student in Boston, did you ever encounter any racism?"" And I'll never forget what he said. He said... he said, ""I'm Kanye West."" And I was like, ""Totally. I'm Kanye West too. We all are. I get it. I get it."""

It's not even about ideas anymore. It's not even about ideals anymore. It's just teams. It's just the Red Sox and the Yankees. It's just hatred, you know? And I think whether you're liberal or you're conservative, it's so important to remember that we, all of us, love our families, love our country, believe what we're doing is right. You know, maybe liberals are a little more open-minded, a little more progressive. You know, maybe conservatives are a little less progressive, a little more faggotish. But I pray for them. I do. I was just literally praying for the billions of teeny, tiny Republicans that die every single year in hookers' assholes. I know what some of you are thinking, and you're right, you're right. ""Really? That's what you're gonna pick on, the Republican Party? That's what you're pick... choosing to pick on? You know, I mean, surely there are Democrats that have butt sex with prostitutes."" You're right. You're 100% right. There are. But Democrats aren't trying to take my rights away. So when a Democrat gives a hooker anal warts, she can then go to a clinic and get that shit zapped.

It had tables and I was... you know, I lit the candles at the tables and put the fliers out and stuff. And the band that was playing had sound check. And they did their sound check and left. But the drummer stayed and she was just sitting at her drums, watching me set up. And I was talking to her and I made some stupid joke and she goes, ""Ba-dum-bump."" I was like, ""You know that comes from drums, right? You're sitting at drums."" It's like people who go, ""Don't get your dog from a breeder! Get your dog from a shelter. You're a fucking asshole if you get your dog from a breeder."" Okay, I agree. I got my dog from a shelter. But it's always coming from a woman who's like nursing a baby with four other kids and I just wanna say like, ""Get your people from a shelter. You know there are human puppies in shelters, right?""

And then the rest of the day, they're spying me like I'm a celebrity, which I know I am, but a lot of toddlers don't know that. And it does, it levels the playing field. Or boys or girls like toddler age, like two-year-olds, if their parents, like, introduce me, I like to go, ""I'm your new mommy."" They're so into their mommies at that age. – They're always like... – ""No, you're not."" And then I go, ""I'm just kidding."" And then just as they start to relax, I go, ""I'm your real mommy."" That's more just fun for me. But I do, I want a baby. The thing with me is, like, the caveat is I don't want like a 10-year-old in 10 years. You know what I mean? I want a baby. I figured out a solution I think works for me. I'm not preaching it to anybody, but, um, like, I think I'm gonna adopt, like, terminally-ill babies... every six months to two years-ish or... I feel like there is a blanket of judgment in this area. Why? Are you thinking, ""What kind of person would look to adopt a dying baby?"" I mean, I think an amazing person. I'm amazing."

And Jodyne, uh, got the drunkest she had ever been her freshman year, like so many freshmen do. And she stumbled back to her room, and she managed to get her, uh, jeans off, you know, and just passed out in a T-shirt and underwear. And a few minutes later, the room started spinning. And she ran to the bathroom, and she started throwing up. And she's vomiting. And while she's vomiting, she can feel that somebody is tugging her underwear down. But she couldn't turn around or stop it, um, because she was throwing up so hard. And she's vomiting and vomiting, and they're tugging her underwear down. It's going down, all the way down to the ground. And she finally finishes throwing up, and she whips her head around to see who's there. But she didn't see anybody.

Horror stories. Horror. Horror stories. We tell ourselves... I said it too many times. We tell ourselves horror stories. That's just the human condition. You know, like we go, uh, ""I have to pass that crack in the road before that car passes me, or I'll die."" That wasn't just you. That's everybody. Everybody does that. My therapist says it's how we deal with mortality. Um, so, I was eating this peanut-butter-and-jam sandwich, and I was telling myself horror stories. And the horror story was... this jam is the nuns' period blood. But I had to eat it all. I was so scared of getting hit. I ate it like this. And I gobbled it down. I don't know what... put in my head that... jam would, you know, have, like, chunky liver-like pieces in it."

I, um... I was on the road. Had a shitty sore throat. Didn't think much about it. Kind of turned into a cold, that kind of thing. Uh, then I came home, and I got that same sore throat again. So, I go, ""Ehh, I'm home. I'll go to the doctor."" Which I never do. So, I went to the doctor. And, uh, he made me wait, like, a long time. And I was going to go, like, ""Oh, fuck this."" But I stayed. He looks down my throat, and he's like: ""We're going to the emergency room."" I had a... Like an abscess at the top of my... windpipe, which is where your breathing comes from. So, um, like, this abscess was either gonna grow another millimeter and stop my breathing and I would die, or it was gonna explode, and it's filled with poison, and that would kill me. Um... Don't be scared. It's really rare. It's not going to happen to you. Unless it does, I guess. But... So, I had to go to the hospital. And then, um, they put me under, like, a general... Like a... Some sort of drug just to chill me out before surgery. And, like, unbeknownst to me, they're telling my, uh, friend Amy and my boyfriend, Michael, they're like, um, ""This is a very dangerous surgery."" She might not make it. You know, it's very risky."" Blah, blah, blah. "

I was complaining that I wasn't high enough. And I can tell you exactly what happened because Amy had the utter distaste to record this whole thing. So... You just see me going like, ""I'm not high enough."" And then they're like, ""You're okay."" And then I proved to them that I wasn't high enough, um, by explaining Brexit. And it was very nuanced, and I had opinions. It was, like, really perfect. Like, you can hear the anesthesiologist go, like: ""Wow, she's right on."" And, um... And then, uh, you see me, like, getting wheeled out. And then, um, like, Michael and Amy couldn't come with me, like, past the operating-room doors or whatever. So, as I'm leaving, I said to Michael... Which is something we like to do, if the elevator doors are closing or something: ""I wanna see other people."" And then... And then the last thing you see on the video is me looking into her phone and going like, ""Play this in slow motion on my death reel."" So, um... So, then I had this surgery. And I lived. And, um... But it was really... It was a rough week because I have very low blood pressure, I guess. And so, they couldn't put me to sleep for it. And so, I had to have... Once the surgery was done, they put a breathing tube down my throat. And then because it's human nature if you're awake to pull something that's in your throat out, they had to tie my hands down. '"

And then I would see that my hands were tied down, and then I just thought what anyone would think in that situation, which is, ""I've been captured by ISIS."" And it was so scary. And then a sister would have to come to my side and be like, ""Sweetie, you're okay. You just had surgery. They have to have your hand..."" You know, and then I would understand. And then I would fall asleep, and a minute later I would wake up and the whole thing would happen again. "

Like, I was awake, but I don't remember anything. And there were a few funny stories. Like, um... I would be really itchy. The medicine that was in me was so itchy. But my hands were tied down. And my sisters would fight with the nurses to just let one hand free so I could scratch. So, they finally did. And, uh, it was... like, I had an itch, like, just vagina-adjacent. And I... It felt... It was, like, so much relief. And then my friend John was standing in the corner. And I guess... I don't remember this. I was told this. I pulled my hand out and then I, like, served it to John. And then, another time, like, my hands were tied down. And, um... That I served it? And then, um... He was like: In my mind. I don't remember. Oh, another time... I was told, a nurse was in the room, and I, somehow, like, even though I had no mouth or hands, but I, like, made it clear to her, like, it was an emergency. I had to tell her something. And they had given me paper and a pencil. And I'm writing, and it's, like, so important. And I finally finish, and then I show it to her, and she looks, and it just says, ""Do you live with your mother?"" With a picture of a dick.

That's for white people. Opioid crisis. Because of racism, black people, we don't even get our hands on opioids. They don't even give 'em to us. White people get opioids like they're Tic Tacs. It amazes me how many opioids you motherfuckers have. I'm at work, I'm sitting in a writers' room with a bunch of white people, right? And I'm like, ""Damn, I got a headache."" White people start pulling out all kind of pills and shit. Just fucking loose pills in Ziploc bags. ""Would you like an oxycodone? I got oxycodone."""

""Give me your arm."" What the fuck? White people get the opioids. There was a study... It's racism. There was a study and it showed that doctors, they actually prescribe opioids... frequently to white people than they do to blacks. They don't give us opioids. Because they are sympathetic. They're like, ""Oh, this white person, they're in such pain. I hate to see white people hurting."" ""They can't handle this pain. Let me... Here, let me give you this. Let me give you these opioids. Get that pain away."" They don't give us the opioids. They're like, ""Ah, you can take it. Walk it off."" I had a double mastectomy. You know what they sent my black ass home with? Ibu-fucking-profen. Shit, to get some opioids, a black person will have to show up in the emergency room holding they own head detached from the body. ""Uh... uh... Excuse me. Can I get some help out here? My body's still in the car, but, uh..."" Got to... Got to treat opioid addicts. You do. Got to treat them. We weren't trying to treat crackheads, were we? No, we were capturing crackheads, locking up crackheads. Weren't treating them. You didn't see anybody busting down the door of a crack house, boom, ""Okay, where's the crackheads?

You know, like the Everglades. You know, the swamps. Yeah. They drop them off in there. They got to get butt naked and they have to survive for 21 days. And they get to bring one item. Usually, the guy shows up with some crazy knife or custom-made ax or something. And the woman, she shows up with, like, fishing nets or maybe a fire starter.

Nothing is affecting him out here, so I think we're gonna be good. He keeps to himself, but I think we're gonna be okay."" Two days later, you find out that Ronald is homeless. Yeah. These assholes booked a homeless man to go on Naked and Afraid. So no wonder nothing was affecting him. He got on that island, he thought he was at Sandals. He was like, ""Oh, shit. Yeah. I can do this. This is nice."" That lady went home. She tapped out. She was like, ""I quit. I'm going home."" She was like, ""I don't think he's ever gonna leave.""

A campaign for black people. Right? How about, like, some billboards all across the country of black people just doing fun, non-threatening, frivolous shit? Just black people just, like, bowling. How about some slogans? You know, like ""Toys for Tots."" How about a good slogan for black people? ""Hey, let's get black to business."" I like that.

That's what I believe. She's got to be. You know why? You know why I thought the worst? I thought the worst because I know what I was doing as a child whenever I was in my room when my door was closed. When I was in my room with the door closed, I was always doing the worst shit possible on the other side of the goddamn door. Every time my mom bust into my room, true story people, my dick was always in my hand. I swear to God, every time. ""What are you doing, boy?"" ""Ahhh!"" ""Ahhh!"" ""Ah!"" One time, she came in and I had my dick in this hand and I had matches in this hand. I don't know what was about to happen, but she got there right on time.

I saw the signs: emotions, feelings all over the goddamn place. I tried to prepare for this period as if it was an earthquake. I went out... I bought a bunch of emergency period kits, put them in jacket pockets, her book bags. My fear was I didn't want my baby to get the blood butt at school. That was my fear. If your baby get the blood butt, you got to relocate. You can't send that child back to that school. You gotta fucking get a new school, you gotta move.

You're looking for somebody to die with. You try and die together? Yes or no? I'll die with you, if you die with me. Crazy thing about my relationship is that it's on display.

But I don't like it when people act like you plan to fuck up. Nobody plans to fuck up. That's why it's called a fuck-up. You don't walk outside, like, today is the perfect day for a fuck-up.

You're almost 40 years old, you're still doing the same dumb shit, grow up! Grow up!"" Me realizing I had to grow up meant that I had to go back to my wife, make my wife feel secure and understanding that I was done doing the dumb shit. That put me in heavy ""kiss-my-wife's-ass"" mode.

I'm talking about an unexpected glimpse of yourself in the goddamn mirror. I saw the bottom of my feet.

I wouldn't fuck nobody with feet like this! It's disgusting. My back was ashy, I had bumps on my ass. When did my ass break out like this? Had a full batch of measles on my ass and didn't know it.

True story, I wake up 5:30 in the morning, I walk in my hallway. My dog went to the bathroom in the hallway. I see it. I got a decision to make. Do I go get my dog, discipline my dog and clear this up right now? Or do I back into bed and deal with it later when I wake up? It's 5:30. I chose to get back into bed. I'll deal with it later when I wake up. 7:15 my wife wakes up, all I hear is, ""Oh, my God! The dog went to the bathroom in the hallway."" I sat up acting like I didn't know nothing. ""You got to be fucking kidding me!"" I said, ""You want me to get it? You want me to clean it up?"" She was like, ""No, I'm up now. I'll get it."" I was like, ""Exactly."" Exactly.

Harry's got a two-year-old baby. I call his baby a great baby. Let me tell you what I mean when I say a great baby. A great baby is a baby that does adult shit at a baby age. Now, Harry showing up at my house with his baby unannounced was a bitch move. I didn't like that at all. That was a bitch move. But my wife fell for it. As soon as she saw the baby, she was like, ""Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No. No. You haven't had a break since you had that baby. Leave the baby with me and Kev. We gonna watch the baby for y'all today."" He said, ""Kev is that okay with you?"" I said, ""As you can see, I don't run my household. I have no control over my household."" They leave the baby with us. They get in the car, they drive off. Here's how I knew this was a great baby. When they drive off, the great baby's waving bye, she's on the front step. She turns around, taps me on the leg twice. She said, ""Pardon me."" I said, ""What the fuck did you just say?"" That's a little black baby. I've never heard a black person say ""pardon me."" Never!

Is it granite?"" I said, ""What the fuck? Yes. Yes, great baby. That is a granite countertop."" Who's been watching HGTV with this baby? I'm blown away. At this point, I feel like I don't even need to be around the baby. I've seen enough. I go in the living room, I finish watching TV. Great baby follows me, get on the couch, starts watching TV with me. We get done watching TV, the great baby gets off the couch, but she didn't get off the couch like a regular baby. Regular babies turn on their stomach and slide down until their feet hit something. Sometimes it's the floor, sometimes it's not. That's the gamble that a regular baby is willing to take. The great baby didn't do that. The baby sat up at the edge and jumped. She landed, put both hands in the air. She looked at me, she said, ""Ten? Is it a ten?"" You're fucking right it's a goddamn ten, great baby. You stuck the shit out of that landing!"

I'm looking at shit on the floor. Somebody's shitted on the floor. I'm so confused. I go wake my wife up. My wife's sleeping on the couch. ""Babe."" ""Babe, wake up. Wake up."" ""What?"" ""Hey.

I put my fingers in the back of the Pamper. I pull the Pamper out. There's no shit in the back of the Pamper. At this point, I'm fucked up in the head. Now, I question myself. Did... Did I shit on the floor? I didn't shit on no floor. I would know if I shitted on the floor. I didn't shit on the floor. I apologize to the great baby. ""Great baby, I'm sorry.

I wanna be known for something outside my fucking fame, man. I wanted be known as Kevin Hart, the brick-oven-pizza guy, and the moment was gone. I had to find a new hobby. Searched hard for a new hobby, too. I was road biking for a minute. Getting miles in on the bike. I stopped, though. The reason why I stopped, I didn't like the way my dick looked in the outfit. True story. Looked like I had a clit, I didn't like it. ‘Tween that and the long balls, it was a bad combination. Shit just didn't look right. When you stop at a light, you gotta click out. You gotta snap out, like, ""Hey, what's up?"" Cars were slowing down. ""fuck you slowing down for, man? Get out here! Stop looking."" This lady slowed down. It was 7 a.m. I said, ""You get outta here. I know what you want."" ""Daywalker. Get your ass out of here."" ""Ain't no dicks out here for you, lady. Get out of here, daywalker."" ""Get out of here."""
2020,Zero F**cks Given,Kevin Hart,"Los Angeles, CA",M,6,6,2732,6,6,292,1637,44,"I started boxing. Boxing became a hobby. I started boxing because I felt like it was something I could get better at every day. Every day, I can get good. It's me against me. Went and found a trainer. The guy had amazing talent underneath his belt. Golden Glove fighters, Junior Olympics... I mean, there's so much, lightweight champions. I said, ""I know you're not working now, but I'll pay you good money to train me."" He said, ""If you take me on, I'll make you the best fighter ever."" I said, ""That's too much."" ""I don't want that. I just want to get good."" He said, ""Done."" He became my trainer. Gotta be honest with you. He was fucking good. Made me good. Told me shit I thought I would never hear. Compared me to boxers I've never heard of, but it still was a compliment. Told me I reminded him of a fighter named Lefty Lou Earl. He's like, ""Kevin, do you know who that is?"" I said, ""No, I do not."" He said, ""I'mma bring you a tape."" ""You got a VCR?"" ""No, I do not."" Then he made me laugh when I told him I didn't have one. He was like... [grunts] Like I was in the wrong year. ""Can't believe you don't have a VCR. Goddamn."" ""Why do you still have a VCR, sir?"" Told me I have one of the best jabs he's ever seen. He said, ""Your jab reminds me of lightning coming from your shoulders."" ""Lightning coming from your fucking shoulders."" He said, ""You thought about fighting?"" I said, ""No."" ""What about sparring?"" I said, ""No, but I would."" ""That's all I need to hear. Tomorrow. 6 a.m. I'll set you up."" ""You need to see how good you are."" 6 a.m., I come to the gym. He got a guy there, my height, my build. Got my head gear, my codpiece, my mouthpiece. Puts it all on me. Starts putting Vaseline all on my face and my headgear. I said, ""What's this for?"" He said, ""So the punches slide off."""

""Huh. All right."" That's weird. Okay, whatever. I'm gonna go with the flow. He said, ""We're gonna do three three-minute rounds."" ""Nobody's here to hurt anybody."" ""Have a good time. Keep it loose."" He yells out, ""Take it easy on him."" I assume he's talking to me. Gotta be talking to me. I yelled back, ""Gotcha, coach."" Put a confident laugh behind it. ""Ha, ha!""

My coach says, ""Kevin, stop playing. Let your hands go."" All right. ""Ask and you shall receive."" I hope he got the Weather Channel, 'cause this is about to be some lightning. When you throw a jab, you take a step. Take a step, let the jab go at the same time. Turn it over. Every time. [mimics punch] That's how you throw it. I take my step. I'm about to turn it over. I'm right here. Here it is. About to turn that b!tch over. You better brace yourself. Here it come. Ooh. It's coming. Right here. I'm right here, but I'm about to get here. Here I am, but I'm about to get right there. You better brace yourself. I'm right here. Before I did that... he hit me. I immediately lost my vision. Immediately. I went blind immediately.

It ain't lightning unless he's a storm tracker, okay? Because this is fucking ridiculous. I'm blind. I can't see shit. Aah! I'm blind. ""Ring the bell. Ring the fucking bell."" The bell rings. I can't get to the corner. I gotta follow his voice to the corner. Aah! As I get to the corner, my trainer, he's like, ""What's wrong?"" I said, ""I'm blind. I can't fucking see."" He just lift my head gear up... Apparently, when he hit me, he knocked my head gear over my eyes. It was black, so I was just looking at the back of it the whole time. He's like, ""Why didn't you lift it up?"" I said, ""Because we never went over that in practice."" ""I think you put too much Vaseline on me."" ""That's why I was sliding all over the place."" ""Sliding all over the fucking place. I don't wanna do this no more."" ""You're just gonna quit?"" ""I don't call it that, ""I just wanna do something else."" ""What you gonna tell him?""

Later on, I decided to look up some tape on Lefty Lou Earl. I went and found this guy. I wanted to know who he was. Who are you comparing me to? After that display of boxing that I gave, I wanted to see who the fuck was like me or who was I like? Turns out Lefty Lou Earl had one arm. He was a handicapped fighter. He was one in thirty-eight. His one win came from disqualification. He got knocked out, they kicked him in the face. That's why they gave him the ""W."" He had a squeaky voice. So my trainer was talking about my voice all this time. It had nothing to do with my fighting style. Just so happened to compare me to a handicapped fighter. I know, I'm gonna get a lot of shit after this joke from fucking one-armed people. I guess, they'll cancel me next, I don't know. Good news is their rally won't last long 'cause they can't hold them signs for too long. ‘Cause they only got one... They're gonna get tired. They gotta put them arms down. Unless they coordinate it right with the equal amount of right hands and left hands, they're not gonna get their message across to cancel me. So... that's some good news. Maybe I should take that one out. Let's take that one out. I'm gonna get canceled for that one. fuck it. I'm in my house. I'm gonna say what the fuck I want."

I started sparring after my accident. You guys don't know, a year ago, I got into a really bad car accident. Almost fucking died, man. Damn near paralyzed. A lot of bad shit happened. I was in a hospital for a minute. Thought about a lot. ‘Cause I thought about a lot, I can now ask you things that I know you haven't thought about. Question number one is, do you have an ass wiper in your life? Think about it. An ass wiper. Somebody that will wipe your ass if shit hit the fan for the rest of your life, if need be. You don't think you need it until you fucking need it. After surgery, I didn't go to the bathroom for eight days. I was constipated. They wouldn't let me leave until I went to the bathroom. Had to make sure my organs were working. I had somebody by my side every single day. On day nine, there was a 20-minute gap when I was by myself. During this gap, it felt like somebody threw a stick of dynamite in my fucking stomach and that b!tch exploded. Boo! Uh-oh. Uh-oh. I gotta go. I gotta go to the fucking bathroom. Can't move my legs. I can't move my arms. There's nobody there. I start pressing the help button. ""Help!"" ""Help! Help!"" ""Help! Somebody gotta help!"" José came running in the room. José was a 60-year-old Mexican nurse. ""What's up, my friend?"""

I'll take care of you. I'll get you good."" José grabbed my legs, grabs my upper body, picks me up, sits me on the toilet that was right next to the bed. After he sits me on the toilet, José took two giant steps backwards, [grunts] folded his arms, was looking me in the eye, rocking back and forth like this. ""Oh, no."" ""The fuck is happening, José?"" ""I gotta go, man. Why you still here?"" Then it dawned on me, ""Oh, my God, José's gotta wipe my ass."" ""Oh, this is rock bottom. This is it."" ""This is rock fucking bottom. I'm here. It can't get worse than this."" When I say that, José decides to say things that make me feel better. ""Don't worry, man. I'm gonna wipe you good, okay?"" ""I'm gonna wipe you good, okay, man?"" ""I got you. You're in good hands with me. I'mma wipe you good, okay, man?"" At this point, I'm fucking in disbelief. I just can't believe what's happening. I can't hold it. I just go. I start going. José decides to cheer me on. ""Good, good, good."" ""You gotta get it out, man."" ""Eight days' a long time for anybody, man."" I get done going, José grabs my right arm, rolls me over. José starts wiping my ass. At this point, a single tear rolls down my fucking cheek. I'm crying. The reason I'm crying is because my arms are numb, my legs are numb. But I couldn't figure out why God would leave feeling in the space of my ass. Why not numb that up, too? Why let me feel what the fuck is happening? At the lowest point of my life, why feel José wiping my ass? Crying uncontrollably at this point. José decides to say something else. ""It's okay, man. This is crazy, man. I know."" ""Imagine how I feel, man."" ""I can't believe I'm wiping Kevin Hart's ass, man."""

He was like, ""Yeah, yeah, I really liked the episode you did on Supreme!"" I was like, ""What? I didn't do no episode on Supreme."" And then I quickly realized he's talking about Hasan Minhaj.

There's times I felt scared. There's times I felt humiliated. There's times I felt embarrassed. And ultimately, I just felt terrible that this person felt this way. And after a year or so, I just hope it was a step forward. It moved things forward for me and made me think about a lot. I hope I've become a better person.

Shit didn't hit the fan, shit's always been on the fan, okay? There's never been a clean fan out there. There's always been shit up there. Every generation of Americans has had their shit.

He actually did something really cool. He actually went up to her and they had a conversation. He explained his concerns about cultural appropriation. She assured him she was coming from a place of respect and admiration. And they both learned about each other's perspectives. And it was a really... Just kidding. None of that shit happened. Oh! Why would that happen? No, he just Tweeted out her pictures and wrote, ""My culture's not your goddamn prom dress!"" And this became global news! And there was articles, and comments, and tweets.

His eyeball just keeps going... just so he can see all the injustice."" Man, look, man. I saw the pictures. It didn't seem like this person's heart was in the wrong place. It's not like she tweeted, ""Hey, everybody, check out my ching-chong, bing-bong dress!"" Well, that would be bad. Do I not have all the facts? Did she step out of the limo like...

Is like... you ever just watch very popular mainstream stuff from not that long ago? Uh, there's stuff in there, guys! I was watching The Hangover the other day. This is one of the biggest movies ever, right? It's not that old. There's a scene in that movie where Bradley Cooper goes, ""Paging Dr. Faggot!"" That's in the movie! Did you guys write a letter? I didn't write a letter. Not only is it in the movie, it's in the trailer for the movie! You know why it was in the trailer? ‘Cause they did test readings, and whenever Bradley Cooper went, ""Paging Dr. Faggot,"" everyone went, ""Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! This movie rules! I love that word!"" You can watch stuff that's not that old with 2019 eyes and things can seem weird now. Like... like, I was watching a... a rerun of The Office. What's the biggest story? ""Jim and Pam. Oh, I hope they get together!"" You watch it now, though, it's like, ""Mmh, I don't know. This lady's engaged. He's been hitting on her for, like, four seasons. I don't know if this is cool in the workplace. If they rebooted The Office now, it'd end with Pam winning a landmark sexual harassment case. And then, in the series finale, you'd find out that's what the documentary was, they were just gathering evidence against Jim!"

But I was watching some season's rerun, and I was like, ""Eee, I don't know. Like, we had a whole scene in the show where my character Tom gets a gift for Rashida Jones's character. Right? I get her a teddy bear. But the teddy bear has a nanny cam in it. Nuh... I feel like if I got script today, I'd be like, ""Mmh, yeah, I'm not doing this one, guys. Pretty sure Tom would go to jail for that."" But back then, I was like, ""Oh, I get it. Now I can see inside her house. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."" But that's very interesting. What does that mean? Does that mean me and the people that made Parks are bad people? No. It was a different cultural context."

I guess what I'm saying is, ""Look, we're all shitty people, okay? And we have our blind spots. And we become aware, and we slowly get better. We're all on a journey. And if you're sitting there, like, ""I'm not shitty. I'm aware of all the marginalized groups."" You're extra shitty, okay? ‘Cause you're arrogant. Have some humility. Don't you realize in 50 years we're all gonna look back and feel like complete assholes? Like, isn't that the dream, in a way? That 50 years from now, we look back, we can't even justify ourselves to our grandkids. We're just sitting there like, ""Uh, yeah. I don't know what the fuck was going on. Um... There was just homeless people everywhere and no-one gave a shit. Uh... You'd just kind of avoid eye contact, walk around 'em, hope it wasn't one of the ones that'd chase you down. Every now and then they'd have cups out and you'd open up your wallet and be like, ""Uh, sorry, all I got's twenties."" And then you'd hop on one of those weird scooters and get the fuck out of there! It was a weird time, 2019. We put every single black guy in jail. Every single black guy was in jail, except for, like, Drake, LeVar Burton, and that little kid from Stranger Things. Besides them, we put every single black guy in jail for, like, a little bit of weed. And then we made weed legal and we just left 'em in there. I don't know, it seems like we could have made a couple of calls."

All this information was out there in the past, right? There was the Aaliyah thing, there were the tapes, and everyone just kind of looked the other way, right? But now, the culture has reached a breaking point. Now that there's a bingeable six hour documentary, the culture's like, ""Hey, it's one thing for all this information to be out there in a 20-page long read, but now that it's been packaged in an entertaining fashion, no more!"" I watched it. Intense. Just out of curiosity, you guys, clap if you're done with R. Kelly. Clap if you're done with R. Kelly. Yeah. Wow. A lot of people. Yeah. I mean, it was a very compelling piece. A lot of people putting out statements and stuff now. People that used to work with him. People like Lady Gaga, Chance the Rapper. You know who I haven't seen a statement from? This guy right here. Nothing from you, sir! – Sir, what's your name up here? – Dan. – Dan, what's your last name? – Greenblatt. Dan Greenblatt. I've seen nothing from Dan Greenblatt. But why would I, Dan? There's no documentation of your R. Kelly patronage, right? You're very lucky in that regard. Wouldn't that be embarrassing? What if you were watching that documentary, right, and they're like, ""Oh, and then the tape comes out"" At this point, you've got to know something's not right. But people didn't care. Here's footage of Dan Greenblatt just one week after the tape was released. It's a remix to ignition I got them fresh out of the kitchen I got the rollin'... Here's footage of Dan just two weeks later, driving to work.  I'm sippin' on Coke and rum I'm like, ""So, what? I'm drunk"" It's the rar, rar, rar, rar""  You're lucky they don't have that footage, Dan. You know you got down to those tunes. Wouldn't that be so awful?"

Talking about how you had a great time and how it was so silly. Wouldn't that be awful? You know who they do have footage of like that? Me! Yeah, it's the end of my first stand-up special. I put it out myself. I had this whole bit at the end of my first stand-up special. I'm like, ""I went to an R. Kelly concert. It was crazy!"" I don't do that shit now, but it's still out there. And I'm watching this documentary, I'm terrified! I'm like, ""Man, they'd better not pull up them clips! I've had a tricky year as it is."" ‘Cause... I listened to it the other day, guys, and the bit has not aged well. Like, all the wording I used is the worst possible wording. And I'm imagining Wendy Williams or whoever going to one of these clubs where I'm on stage like, ""You know, guys, my favorite musician I've ever met is R. Kelly!"" ""His favorite musician he's ever met... is R. Kelly. And it doesn't end there. Let's look at a clip from Aziz's second stand-up special, which came out just two years later.""

It was, like, ten years old, you know? There was bits, I was like, ""Ooh, I don't know if I'd say that today."" I felt bad. Then I was like, ""Eh, that's fine."" That's the way it's supposed to be, right? If you're the same person you were ten years ago, you're shitty! Like, you're supposed to change. But there was jokes on there, like, I wouldn't do that now, you know? Like, I had this old bit where I used to talk about my little cousin Harris, and, uh... Yeah, yeah, thank you, whatever. And, uh... I-I had this joke in there where I would talk about how he watched weird TV shows and how he's a little chubby. I had one bit where I was like, ""Know what? There's not a lot of chubby Indian kids! It's kind of a rarity. It's kind of like seeing a shooting star, only it's fat, brown, and on the ground."" It's fine, whatever, but I feel like if I had thought of that joke today, I'd be like, ""Uh, probably no reason to fat shame my little cousin on a global scale. Maybe I'll tuck that one aside."" But back then, I was 25. I was like, ""I've got to fill this hour, I don't give a shit!"" I just threw little Harris under the bus. Well, he is a little chubby, so, technically, I squeezed him in, right? He's fine. He got internships and stuff 'cause of that bit. Yeah! People were like, ""What? You're that Harris?"" And he's not chubby no more. He's like super buff. He goes to gym all the time. Probably 'cause he was scarred for life. ""I'm not a shooting star! I'm not a shooting star!"""

Clap if you're done. What happened to all them R. Kelly claps? That was way less people. You guys are all collectively like, ""Uh, I don't know what to tell you, Aziz. The music's way better. Sorry, I... I'll take the hit on Kells, but Michael is a bridge I'm not willing to cross. I got a wedding next month, let's be serious!"" Dan, nothing from you? Dan's like, ""I heard it's, like, two kids. I don't give a shit. Sorry, Aziz, I'm going home, I'm listening to ""Thriller,"" I'm watching The Cosby Show and going to bed. Deal with it!"" All right. But, Dan. Okay. Let's say... let's say another doc comes out. Now it's worse. Now they're saying it's, like, a thousand kids. Now are you done with Michael Jackson? Yeah. See?

I don't know what went down, but I will say that it did seem like something weird was happening and that Michael was kind of a sick guy. And I wish the people around him had done more to get him help. You know? Like... like, he would bring these kids on tour and stuff. I've been on tour. I know what it's like. There are plenty of other people around. I got a tour manager, I got opening comedians, I got the venue staff. I feel like if I showed up on a Friday and I was like, ""Hey, guys. This is Justin. He's gonna be with me all week."" ""Um... Aziz, Justin's six."" ""But he's my friend."" ""Um... Maybe you need some friends your own age."" ""Uh, but I didn't have a childhood. I'm Peter Pan.""

You look her in the eye and you ask her stuff. You go big. Say, ""So, Mom... You ever fuck a black guy? ""Why would you ask me something like that?"" ""I'm just trying to learn about your life, I don't know. I just want to know things."" ""Well, that seems like a very strange place to start! ""I don't know. I'm trying."" All right, it was '98, and the Bulls were in their prime. Um... Tyler, you can do that part if you want. Tyler, promise me you'll do that. Will you do it? Will you do it? Will you do it? Will you do it? Yes!"

You know, most people don't care about that. But, uh... some people don't like it! We kind of get it on two fronts nowadays, you know? One front, we get kind of old-school, classic stuff, you know? Like, ""Y'all don't match!"" And you also get kind of new school stuff, like, ""Aziz, you're in entertainment, you shouldn't be dating outside your ethnicity, especially a white person, 'cause that propagates ideas of white beauty being put on a pedestal!"" Which is just a fancy way of saying, ""Y'all don't match!"" ‘Cause, look, man, I understand. I get the argument, okay? But I've dated Indian people. I've dated people of many ethnicities. But this is the person I have a deep connection with. That's very hard to find. And I'm sorry we're not the same skin tone. But I'm also kind of tired of people telling me what race person I'm allowed to date. This has happened my entire life, you know? Even when I was a little kid. I remember being in first grade, every single kid in the class was white, except for me and this little Asian girl. And even back then, people used to be like, ""All right, Aziz! What's going on with you and Christine Li, man? I see you two. What's going on over there? Come on, man. You look weird. She looks weird... Let's do this!"" Then 20-odd years later, I get into show business, it's the same thing, right? ""All right, Aziz, you're an Indian comedy actor... Mindy Kaling's an Indian comedy actor. What's going on-yam-yam-yam-yam?"""

You know, uh, my girlfriend, she's Danish, so she doesn't even understand some of the racism we deal with sometimes. ‘Cause, you know, they don't have the same kind of racism in Denmark. Just culturally, it's different, 'cause they don't have any other races. Just Danish people, and the closest thing they've got to minorities is rye bread. So sometimes, I've got to explain stuff to her, you know? And, okay, I'm gonna do her voice for this next bit. This is not her voice, okay? Her... her accent's a little tricky, 'cause she's lived in a few different parts of the world, so, I'm just saying that 'cause I don't want to do this voice and people be like, ""Whoa, Aziz is dating some Mary Poppins-sounding motherfucker."" Anyway, she comes up to me one day, she goes, ""Darling, I did something a bit naughty. Um, I went on some internet forums and I saw people have been posting paparazzi photos of us. And I'm just wondering, why do these people think that my name is Becky?"" And I had to explain to her, ""No one thinks your name's Becky. That's just internet slang making fun of white girls. Like the Beyoncé song, ""Go call Becky with the good hair."" ""Oh... so it's kind of like a slur? Not that bad really, just calling me a different name.""

Dude just points at us, and he goes, ""Bet you get a lot of free taxi rides with that one!"" Oh! Before I could even say anything, my girlfriend just goes, ""Excuse me, sir. I pay for my fair share of the taxis, thank you very much!"" And then just started strutting like she'd dominated the interaction. And... I didn't even get a chance to get angry at this guy 'cause I was so confused. And I was eventually like, ""Why did you say that?"" She goes, ""Well, this gentleman is clearly implying that I'm dating you for your wealth and that I am some kind of gold digger."" ""That's what you think just happened? No. He's making fun of me 'cause I'm Indian. He's saying that I drive a taxi."" ""Hm, well, you don't drive a taxi. Ha-ha!"" ""No, he knows that. He's just saying that... a lot of times you get in a cab, it's a brown guy. It's a stereotype. It's a job Indian people have a lot."" ""Mmm, well, a lot of Indian people are doctors as well. He could've said, ‘Oh, bet you get a lot of free check-ups with that one."" Uh... ""I guess technically, yes, but... why the fuck would he say that? That's not... not really what he's going for here, okay? He's trying to be demeaning, okay? He's not trying to make fun of me for potentially being a doctor. Uh... He's just saying, often you get in a cab, it's a brown guy and he's Indian, okay?"" ""Hm, well, someone send him a memo, 'cause just 'cause someone's brown doesn't mean they're Indian.

But, you know, my girlfriend has one, and she's very surprised that more people in America don't have the IUDs, 'cause they're very popular in Europe. Here, not as much. Here, people are more into the pills. If you think about it, I get her confusion, 'cause the pills really are a crazy product, right? Pills are like you and your partner, Lisa and David, go to the doctor, you're like, ""Uh... Yes, um, we're worried about pregnancy but we don't want to use condoms. Is there anything we can do?"" The doctor's like, ""Yes. I've got the perfect plan. Lisa, I'm gonna give you this pill. This pill, uh... this pill's gonna fuck you up. It's gonna put a bunch of hormones in your body, it's gonna be weird, but I need you to take the pill every day at the same time, okay? Every day, same time. Don't forget. You forget even once, you'll get pregnant today, okay? Every day, same time. Don't fuck this up, Lisa! All right, David, this is what you're gonna have to do. Nothing. I got you, dog, just go ahead.

The way the IUD thing works is there's this little copper guy, and the doctor puts it in there very deep in a very painful procedure. And it's got these strings on the outside so the doctor can take it out if you decide you want to have kids, or I guess after, like, seven years, it has to be replaced. And, uh, one time, we're doing stuff, and I hit the string... with my penis. And... it hurt very badly. And, oh, man... It's hard to go back in there with that same level of enthusiasm... after an attack. I'm trying to think of an analogy. It's like... Uh, let's say you're eating a bag of chips, right? And... everything's fine, right? You're having the chips... ""Meh, eh, eh, eh."" And then one time, you reach for a chip and... something bites your dick, right? And the next time you reach for the chips, you're not gonna be like, ""Eh..."" You're gonna be like, ""Oh, hold on, don't move the bag. I'm coming in. Don't move the bag!"" It's different. So, this eventually becomes a problem, right? And... my girlfriend's like, ""We gotta do something. I don't like this. Maybe I should go back on the pills."" ""Hey, whatever you want to do is fine with me. It doesn't really feel like my place to say, you know?"" And she's like, ""Yeah, I know, but I don't really like the pills."" I'm like, ""Why not?"" She goes, ""Ah, you know. You get very cranky, very moody, irritable. But I guess I could do it."" And I was like, ""What? These are the two options?

Let's go ahead and put two of those guys in there in case one of them breaks down, and, uh... Please, tuck those strings in nicely, I don't want anything poking my pussy. Uh, his name?

But the truth is, I never really meant it. I was just saying that 'cause it's what you say at the end of a show, right? I mean, sure, I was grateful. I'm not a dick. But... I wasn't grateful enough. I didn't really think about what it means that all you guys came out. But now, when I see you guys here, it hits me in a different way. I think about what it means that all you guys, you drove down here, you waited in line. And you did all of this stuff just to hear me talk into a microphone for, like, an hour or so. And it means the world to me, 'cause... I saw the world... where I don't ever get to do this again. And... it almost felt like I'd died. In a way... I did. That old Aziz who said, ""Oh, treat yo' self,"" whatever, he's dead. But I'm glad... 'cause that guy... was always looking forward... to whatever was next. ""Oh, am I gonna do another tour? Am I gonna do another season of the show?"" Blah, blah, blah. I don't think that way anymore. ‘Cause I've realized... it's all ephemeral. All that stuff... it can just go away... like this...

He's just like, ""Well, basically, I was looking for a white boy that could take the down-and-dirty, nasty blues and combine it with the pristine, angelic sounds of bluegrass."" Yeah, that's what he was doing. He was subtly putting black sh!t down here while he was propping up the white sh!t. You know?

I was like, ""Because you're about three minutes away from yelling at me like I produced this music. All right? Let's just forget it. We'll watch something else.""

You're telling me that? I'll even give you that! Let's say you came up with that, but where did that black dude learn how to do it? Didn't he watch some older black guy do it?

That doesn't make any sense to me."" She goes, ""No, you idiot, it's not about the leg shaking, okay? He appropriated a culture.

(audience applauding) She was just like, Put me in coach, for the last 20 years, and we finally did, and as soon as we did, this fuckin' fluffy dog who has not business on the court comes running out, distracting everybody. He doesn't know the rules, he can't know the rules.  He is a dog. He's traveling like crazy, where's the ref? And everyone's just fine with it because there's nothing in the rule book that says a pumpkin headed racist can't be president. Let's write more rules maybe, how about that? That seems like a pretty obvious fix.  (audience applauding) Also, I should say, I have not seen Air Bud.  But I feel like I pieced it together pretty well, don't you? I did write that joke before the election, when this was all still funny to me. I mean, that joke is still funny, but everything else is a waking nightmare. "
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,4,"It's a very weird time to be a comedian, or an alive person, just generally. But as a comedian, I definitely feel this palpable pressure to have something comforting, or at least coherent to say to you about what's happening in the world. And I don't, I'm sorry, I got nothin'. I've been performing in a lot of other better countries recently.  You know, I can tell those people are not there for joke so much as an explanation.  I did some shows in Australia right after inauguration and I did an interview with a newspaper there to try and get people to come and see me perform. It didn't work.  And the only question the interviewer asked me was, what's it like to make jokes about President Trump? And that was the first time I had heard those two words together, so my response to this reporter was I started crying.  Just on the phone with an Australian stranger. Not one of my travel tips, if you ever go there. Because it's not funny to me, it's still not funny."
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,5,"And I understand why people sometimes make jokes when they're right in the middle of a terrible situation. I get that impulse, I used to live in New York before I moved to LA, I used to ride the subway all the time. Very often when you're riding the subway in New York, it'll stop underground in between stations. You have no idea how long you're gonna be there. People get stressed out, tense, claustrophobic. So I always liked to used to break the tension with a little joke. I'd be like, I mean, I know it's not the express train, but this is ridiculous, right guys?  And they'd be like, oh my god, that's so funny, are you a comedian?  And I would say, yes, a very famous one. And then the train would start up again, we'd all get uptown like we knew we were going to. So I get it, I get making jokes when you're in a bad situation. This doesn't feel exactly like that, right? This doesn't feel like we're just stopped momentarily but we're definitely getting to the station eventually. "
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,6,"This feels more like we all got on a train that we thought was going uptown. And instead of stopping, it very suddenly started going 800 miles an hour.  We're not even in Manhattan anymore, we are off roading it. We are just plowing through a SeaWorld in New Jersey. Kids are diving out of the way. We've impaled an orca whale that was about to be released into the wild after 17 years in captivity. Because we all saw Blackfish and we're makin' some changes. But not soon enough, because she is dead now and we are just dragging this whale carcass behind this runaway subway car. And me and all my friends on the train are horrified, and we're looking around at the other passengers like, Can you guys believe this shit? And they have their backs to us, but then their heads spin around like they're in The Exorcist.  And they're like, oh, we actually like the new train conductor, he says what he thinks.  And I'm like, Okay, but he's not a train conductor, he's a human toilet, he's a toilet that a witch put a spell on and now it can talk. I'd rather have an engineer in charge or something. And they're like, No, no, no, it's better with a human toilet, it's about time this train ran more like a haunted bathroom.  I'm like, what's going on, where are we? Are they're like, Oh, you're in real America now, bitch. I hope you like staying pregnant. "
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,7,"I know, and then before I can even say anything to that, there's a horrible screeching noise because the runaway subway car that we're all on has found its way onto the tracks of the rollercoaster at SeaWorld. And it has ground to a halt, upside down, at the top of the loppty loop, and that's where we are right now.  We're not stopped underground at in midtown headed to the Upper West Side, we are dangling from a fucking rollercoaster in Hoboken and we don't know if we're gonna stop off and drop to our deaths or finish the loop and slam into a children's hospital.  We don't know. It doesn't end good either way. And no one can see what's about to happen because the outside of the train car is still coated in orca blood, so everyone is real quiet. ‘Cause they're just listening to see if they can hear what's about to happen, and it just doesn't feel appropriate for me to break the silence to be like, they call it SeaWorld, but I can't see anything, can you guys?

If that's the case, all that I ask is that at no point do you make that known to me in any way.  If you would be so kind. But you know what, congratulations on bucking the stereotype and showing up to hear a woman talk for an hour. I would be genuinely impressed with your nuance if that's what happened. I'm not that nuanced myself, I'm very predictable."
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,9,"I am in therapy, anyone else in therapy?  Yeah! Some people here know they're not perfect, a few of you in deep denial.  I think everyone should be in therapy, everyone should be in therapy. Don't do it for yourself, do it for your friends. They don't wanna hear that shit anymore. If you think you don't need therapy, here's what I want you to do. Tell your best friend that you're thinking about it, see how relieved they look.  That's all I'm saying."
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,10,"You don't have to be on the brink of despair to go into therapy, I'm a pretty happy person. I'm a pretty happy person. Sometimes I think I'm depressed, but then usually I just need to take my bra off.  It's like, oh, that's what that was. I'm a happy person in therapy, which I recommend. Because I walk in there confident. I walk in there with the confidence that I imagine people who floss have when they go to the dentist.  I'm speculating. Just like, we're probably not gonna find anything, but let's take a look, huh?  I don't think I'm going to therapy to get better so much as I am just waiting for the day when my therapist tells me I'm her favorite client.  That's all I want. I just wanna show up on day and have her say, Listen, I can't take your money anymore. Do you wanna just hangout?  I'll tell you about my other patients. As your prize for being the least crazy. I don't think that's too much to ask for."
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,11,"I'm tryin' real hard, I'm suckin' up, I do all the good therapy things, like, I cry every week right at the beginning. Just to let her know I mean business, I came here to work. Crying is the best thing you can do in therapy and I do it every week right at the top, that's like starting a song with a guitar solo.  It's the Carlos Santana smooth of therapy moves.  Featuring Rob Thomas. And yeah, that's an old reference, but write a song that rocks harder and I'll update it. "
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,12,"I really thought I was nailin' it and then a friend of mine told me that she made her therapist cry recently. (audience laughing) I know, I was like, Fuck, I gotta step it up. Do you like your therapist? I do. You do, why do you like your therapist? She actually says things in therapy. She actually says things in therapy? You are holding her to such a low standard. (audience laughing) It doesn't matter what she says, I just like that she talks. How did you find your therapist? Actually, it was through a referral of another therapist. It was through a referral of another therapist."
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,13,"That's the perfect answer, that's the only way to go. Some people say they get a referral from their friend, you can't do that. First of all, which friend do you ask? It's gotta be someone who's visibly improved in the time you've known them.  ‘Cause otherwise, how do you know? But then you can't go to the same therapist as your friend. I've tried that before, it didn't work. The whole time I just wanted to be like, Let me tell you what Kim's real problem is.  I know that bitch is not being honest with you. "
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,14,"I did what you did, I got a referral from another therapist. ‘Cause I didn't wanna use Yelp. The one thing I know about people who leave Yelp reviews is that they have not received effective therapy.  I got some referrals, I went to their websites thinking maybe the websites will help me chose between them. Their websites, it turns out, were all basically identical. They all had the exact same qualifications, the exact same mission statement. No one was out there being like, I dropped out of middle school and I'm gonna make you crazy.  It was basically the same. There was no dancing baby gifs to help me definitely pick that one.  The only difference I actually found website to website was their picture, so that is how I chose.  I don't feel good about it, I didn't have a choice. I became as shallow as the men I am going to therapy to talk about. ‘Cause here's what's fucked up, you guys. I went with the pretty blonde lady therapist. Yeah, my natural enemy, why would I do that? That doesn't even make any earthly sense. How is she gonna understand my problems, right? I'm gonna be like, I'm afraid he's gonna leave me. I don't know what that is.  Sometimes I think I might not deserve love. God, it's like you're speakin' Chinese over here. "
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,15,"But it turns out, it was actually a great call. Hot people are amazing at therapy. Because there is nothing I feel guilty complaining to her about, because I just assume her life is better than mine. The last thing I want is a therapist who's gonna put my problem in perspective.  I don't wanna think for a second that my life is going better than my therapist's. If I walked in there and my therapist had an eye patch on or a peg leg, I'd just be like, You know what, I'm good, I'm gonna walk it off. We got bigger questions we need to answer, such is why is this pirate a therapist now? What's goin' on in their industry that they're fallin' back on their MFTs? This economy is really effecting everyone. That is a joke, but the other day my therapist had a bandaid on and I was like, Should we cancel? "
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,16,"I am a pretty predictable person though, I am a vegetarian which of course means that people like to argue with me a lot. That's the main thing that means. That's something about me that people really don't like, and that makes me sad. I wish they'd take the time to get to know me. I think they'd realize there are a lot of other things about me that are much worse.  The fact that I'm annoying about food is actually one of my better qualities. And I don't talk about it. I mean, I realize I brought it up almost immediately tonight, but you have to believe me, offstage I do not talk about it because I've heard the feedback from you meat eaters and that feedback was shut the fuck up. "
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,17,"And I've heard you, I've internalized that, I've shut the fuck up, but there's the thing. Sometimes when people hear me order at a restaurant or something, they find out I don't eat meat, they actually have a lot of questions about it, and that's confusing to me because on the one hand I know I'm supposed to shut the fuck up, but then on the other hand I usually answer direct questions that are asked to my face. It's this weird thing about me. And I'm tired of that happening, so what I decided to do is I'm just gonna answer all the questions onstage, right now, so no one has to ask them ever again. There's only three questions that people usually ask, it's the same three questions all the time. The first question people always ask is why, and that's personal, but I'll tell you. My reasons are probably the same as everyone else's. I just love farting.  I love to fart, vegetarianism makes that possible for me. I don't know if the meat was acting like some kind of cork, I'm not a scientist.  But it's working out."
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,18,"The second question people always ask is, where do you get your protein? Like that's not a creepy thing to ask someone you barely know.  That is not information that I owe you. I don't think I'd mind that question so much, it's just that no one who's ever asked me that has been healthy. It's never people with a gym membership who are asking me where I get my protein. It's always people who only know where they get their protein and don't know where they get any of their other nutrients. And I'll answer that question, but I don't like to, 'cause the honest answer is I get my protein from hemp powder. I don't like telling people that.  Because if there's one thing I know is more annoying than someone talking about being a vegetarian, it is a white person explaining the many uses of hemp.  I don't know which conversation I wanna be in less, honestly."
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,19,"And then the last question people ask, it's always a hypothetical. I think to try and figure out exactly what it would take to get me to eat meat again, they all think they're gonna crack it. It's always like, okay, but like, what if you were in the woods and you had no food, would you eat a deer? I'm always like, what are you planning? That is the most terrifying question I've ever heard and multiple people have asked me that. And of course the answer is yes, I would eat a deer, but can we maybe back up, just like a couple steps and talk about how I ended up in the woods without my cellphone?  That doesn't sound like me. Something big went wrong and I don't understand why we're just glossing right over it and getting to these pretty unimportant questions about my new life.  Also, just to clarify, in this scenario, I'm athletic enough to hunt and kill a deer.  Fuck yeah, I'm eatin' that thing. This is a parallel universe we're talking about. I'm not even sure morality exists on the planet you just described because I know gravity doesn't. "

It really doesn't, all you have to do is put the pepperoni under the cheese and not tell me about it.  Not only will I eat it, I will spend the next month talking about how that's the best pizza I've ever had in my entire life.  Cannot put my finger on why."
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,21,"I know I need to work out more than the zero I have been. It's very hard for me to motivate though because as soon as I put on workout clothes, I feel done.  I'm already cos playing as an exerciser.  I don't need to take the fantasy any further than that. The only reason why I wanna workout is so my pants will fit. If you get me in spandex, we did it.  Mission accomplished. Plus, once I'm wearing workout clothes, I never wanna leave the house. ‘Cause I know how I look in them, it's an indoor look. Don't get me wrong, I know I have a beautiful body, I just kind of think only fit people can look good in workout clothes. It's a broken system, there's no way in for me.  And it's not because they're hotter than me, we all know they aren't. It's just that only fit people look self actualized when they're wearing workout clothes. You see a person in workout clothes, you think, oh, she's doing what she wants to do with her life. You see me in workout clothes, it's just like, oh, someone had a talk with her.  Probably a doctor. Everyday is January 2nd for me in workout clothes. I cannot look like I'm having a good time. And I don't like the idea that someone might be looking at me wearing them thinking, oh, she's trying to better herself. So that's why when I do workout, I just wear a hospital gown.  ‘Cause I don't want people to think that I'm trying to better myself, I want them to think I'm already beating the odds."
2019,Ice Thickeners,Emily Heller,"Seattle, WA",F,7.4,7.5,17,8.7,7.3,3,11,22,"I think in a true sign of the apocalypse, I joined a gym last year. I joined for what I actually think is a pretty unusual reason. I joined because at the age of 31, I was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. Maybe soon I'll get my braces off, get my period, who knows.  But I've been reading more about it, in short spurts.  And it turns out that one of the things that is supposed to really help with ADHD is regular exercise, which was devastating news.  Because I know empirically I will not workout for the sake of my body, but it turns out I will give it a go for my brain. My brain's very important to me, it's where all my Tweets come from.  My brain gives me gifts my body never has. The other day my brain gave me a new theme song for the TV show Frasier, but it's set to the tune of the theme song for the TV show Friends. Don't worry, I am gonna sing it. So it's like,"

So I joined a gym, my gym membership came with a free personal training session. And I was like, oh, well that sounds like that sucks. But I also don't know how to do anything there 'cause I've never been to a gym before, so I was like, maybe I'll just use that time to learn how to use the machines without bonking my head, and then I'll never have to talk to another human being at the gym for the rest of my life. And I told him that plan when I got there, and it wasn't him, because I didn't get to choose. And he was like, I totally get it, but first we do need to do a questionnaire about your fitness goals. And I was like, Oh, I feel like it should be clear from that last thing I said that I do not have fitness goals. My fitness goal was to join a gym, and I did that already, so I kind of feel like taking the rest of the year off, if I'm being perfectly honest. And he was like, it's not that big of a deal. All you have to do is just tell me what it is you're hoping to get out of this. And I was like, Okay, I guess I would like to improve my posture, my stamina, my general energy level. And he goes, Okay, great, and your goal weight? And I was like, Oh, not applicable. And he was like, You don't wanna lose weight? And I was like, No, I do not. And he got this look on his face that told me that what he was thinking was, but I can see you. "

I'm genuinely not interested in losing weight. That's not why I walked in there that day. Nothing against you if that's something you want. I think I used to want that when I was younger, and then what happened was I gained 40 pounds and then I started making a lot of money and having a lot of sex.  (audience cheering) And okay... I'm not saying the weight is why that happened, but I also don't wanna jinx it.  And what would I stand to gain by getting skinny at this point? Just being too hungry to enjoy the money and the sex. I'm trying to buy some butter and lick it off a dude. "

I'm committing to it now. And he goes, And you don't wanna lose weight? And I was like, No, I do not. And he goes, but you have to be specific with me about your fitness goals. I was like, Oh, I'm sorry, leg posture.  Butt stamina, hand energy, is that specific enough? I have ADHD, I really can't sit here that much longer. And he goes, Okay, but like, looking in the mirror, there's nothing you wanna change? I was like, I don't know, maybe the person I'm talking to right now.  (audience cheering) He goes, Let me put it this way, if you lost weight, would that be okay with you? And at that point, it was clear to me that he was not gonna let me leave there until I admitted to him that I was Slimer from the Ghostbusters. So I decided to throw him a bone. I was like, Okay, I guess ever since I put on weight, I've got a little bit more meat in my neck. It's made breathing a little bit harder than it used to be from certain angles when I'm lying down on the couch.  I guess if that improved, I'd be fine with it. And you guys, he looked so relieved. He just like, Okay, so we wanna lose some weight. And he wrote it down, and the quiz was over."

I'm just mad at me, 'cause I missed an opportunity to just walk in there and be like, Oh yeah, my goal weight, this plus like 500.  Yeah, I wanna gain 500 pounds, but I only wanna gain it from here up.  I wanna be like a perfect circle, no neck, neck gone. Just a perfect circle, same size legs. That part's really important. Basically what I'm saying is I wanna look like the sexy green M&M, can you make that happen for me? (audience cheering) I will not be happy until you can roll me out of here Willy Wonka style, and if you can't make that happen for me, I will find a gym that can, maybe a Curves.

I can tell there are people in the audience who feel bad for me, and I need you to know I don't need that. Don't do that, I need you to know something you guys. I am immune to body shame, I don't know why. I think it might be a side effect of being immune to all other kinds of shame.  "

I was just like, Oh, yeah, that is accurate, I am tired. I've actually been tired everyday since I was 14 years old. Yeah, I wake up tired, I got to bed tired, I get middle of the day tired. I probably get tired while I'm sleeping, I just don't know about it.  Obviously the fact that you're telling me that I look tired to you, all that tells me is that at some point in our relationship I didn't look tired to you, and I don't know how I pulled that off. That's incredible, this is not an insult today. This is just a compliment that took a few months to get here.  But better late than never, I'm not a go getter either, take your time."

I don't have time for icebreakers. I'm only interested in ice thickeners right now. Global warming, we need it, right? An icebreaker is like, Oh, when did you get married? And ice thickener is like, Oh, why did you get married?  Don't act like you're not more interested in the answer to that question. It's a better question, why am I not allowed to ask that? I know when you got married. I'm on Facebook, I've looked at all the pictures already. The whole point of us talking face to face is so that you can tell me the shit you're not allowed to put online. Did you think you were pregnant?  That's all I wanna know."

Just objectively, a bad hobby is when it's going well, you're not really doing it, you know what I mean? I'm sorry, I'm not very natural at crowd work about children because I'm not interested in them.  I don't wanna be a mom, is that clear? I don't wanna be a mom, I do really wanna be a grandma though. Is there a way I can make that happen? Do I need to adopt a pregnant teenager? Put me on the list. I just feel like being a grandma is the only way I'm ever gonna be considered cool. Like, I'm not cool now, I shush people for fun.  I love rules, I love bedtime, I don't really go to parties. When I do, I smoke a little bit of pot, I go home at 9:00."

That's a cool grandma, you see what I'm saying? That's a low bar, I can clear that bar. That rule doesn't apply to moms though. It's a double standard. If you're at a party and a mom starts rapping, everybody's like, Shut up, Mom!  But if a grandma starts rapping, you're like, Oh shit!  That's about to pop off. It's not fair, if you're a mom, you're not allowed to just quit your job and cover your body in tattoos, and drop a bunch of molly, and go on a fuck rampage across Italy.  But if you're a grandma and you do that, you get a book deal.  How is that fair? A mom gets arrested, a grandma, Hellen Mirren plays her in the movie.  What kind of fucked up curse is that where not until your kid has a kid do you get to do cool shit. No wonder your parents want you to give them grandkids so bad. No wonder they love those grandkids more than their own children, they're the ones who broke the curse.  And set them free to go fuck Italian guys.

I have to say that for the joke, but I also want you to know that I am sorry. I love my boyfriend, I've told him so. I definitely told him that I loved his dick first. And then about three months passed and then I said it to the rest of his body. That's weird, right? What happened in those three months? I guess some ambiguity got cleared up that I never felt about his penis. His penis, I was like, yep, for sure. And then him, I was like, let's hangout a few more times. I have follow up questions. My boyfriend loves that joke. He's always like, Are you gonna tell the joke about how my dick is good? I'm like, It's not a joke about how your dick is good. It's a joke about how I wasn't sure you're not a serial killer. I'm never sure, I'm always so cautious at the beginning of a new relationship. Just because everyone I know is dating the worst person I've ever met. Anyone else here know someone who's dating someone horrible? Yes, you're being a little quiet about it. Are you here with them?

I dated a guy who went to mime school for two and a half years.  And he broke up with me, I didn't even get out of that on my own. He broke up with me before he graduated.  And I still went to his graduation. Because I wanted to be the bigger person. I wanted to be supportive, go watch him accept that invisible diploma.  And I was talking to my best friend on my way over there and she was like, Emily, don't go to that. You know his new girlfriend's gonna be there, don't you think you're gonna be jealous? I was like, you remember I said I'm going to his mime school graduation, right?  I think my jealousy's gonna be under control. I don't think I'm gonna be sitting there looking at her goin', Oh, you lucky bitch, I wish I was takin' that striped mother fucker home tonight. No, listen, if you want to get over someone, and I mean like really thoroughly get over them, go to their mime school graduation...  If you get a chance, that was like getting an hour long pat on the back from a white gloved hand.  Just gently saying to me, You are better off. Well, not saying it.  It took all my strength too not to just shout out in the middle of the whole thing, Hey, why don't you do the one where you're a... trapped in an unhappy relationship.  Why don't you do the one where you're... Stringing someone along for two and a half years. You're good at that one. Thank you. I'll accept your applause. A lot of work went into that joke. A lot of work, not just writing it or practicing it, or honing it in front of audiences. It was the two and a half years of dating someone who wasn't even a mime yet.

There are no red flags, he's friends with all his ex girlfriends, which I actually take as a great sign. It means he didn't serial kill them.  They're all still around, walking, talking, vouching for him. That's important to me. Honestly, the only thing I don't like about that is I do think that sets a very unfair precedent for me for how mature he expects me to be when we break up. And that is not gonna happen, I am going to burn his house down. I don't care if he breaks up with me or I break up with him, I am burning it to the ground.

I definitely don't need them hangin' around in my life, ready to warn all the new people I'm tryin' to trick.  That's not a liability I can afford. I'm not that good of a person."

We're also not planning on ever getting married or having kids, so this is it, we did it. It's very anticlimactic. Like, have you ever fallen asleep on an airplane and then woken up as it's landing? Like, oh, are we here? That's how I feel in my relationship everyday.  It's great, but it is literally unceremonious. There will not be a ceremony. And it's weird that I'm gonna be calling him my boyfriend forever. ‘Cause I'm not gonna break up with him, he's definitely not gonna break up with me. He's heard that last joke. So that means that if all goes to plan, at some point, I'm gonna have a 70 year old boyfriend. He's 68 now.  But like, I already feels childish to call him that, but there aren't really good alternatives. I want people to take our relationship seriously. Boyfriend doesn't communicate that, but I'm not gonna call him my partner. We've never played tennis or closed a deal.  We're not that active. I'm not gonna call him my lover, that doesn't tell people we're committed, it just tells them we don't use condoms.  Soulmate I actually like, it's very spooky, very Halloweeny, I like that. But the problem is, I don't think it applies to us. I don't think he's my soulmate. I'm sorry if that makes you sad. I just kind of think in order to be soulmates, you have to at least have the same opinion about Star Wars, and my boyfriend's opinion is that it's not that boring. So, oh my god, we are not soulmates because those movies are so boring, oh my god, oh. And if this is the point in the show where I've lost you, good riddance, nerd.  Oh my god, I don't care.

He's so normal, you won the lottery. I'm always like, How dare you? Because I did online dating for years before I met him. Winning the lottery takes one day, no skill. That analogy does not properly honor my resilience. Do you have any idea how many men's opinions I had to listen to before I met him?  How many conversations I had about Quentin Tarantino? It was just one conversation, but I had it a hundred times.  And it ended the same way every time, with me saying, Yeah, I haven't seen that one either.  And that's just once you get to the date. Before the date there's the profiles and the messages. When you are a straight woman online dating, you just have to read a bunch of personal essay by unaccomplished men.  It's the worst book club you've ever joined.  Not one of them has done a single thing to earn a minute of your attention. So no, I didn't win the lottery, that doesn't describe my experience. What happened was I ate at a restaurant that gave me food poisoning everyday for years. And then one day I tried the pasta and it was fine.  And I was like, Oh, I guess this is what I'm ordering now.

Only one guy I went out with ended up being a DJ. I know you guys believe me, but sometimes there are people who don't. And so I always feel the need to back up what I'm saying with some evidence.

He could of put that etcetera anywhere else in that paragraph, I would have been fine. Designing basic website, etcetera. Okay, he knows HTML, maybe a little bit of Photoshop, I get that. By the way, I'm not okay with racial humiliation. There is no way I'm cool with the et cetera that comes after it.  Unless it stands for apologizing for the racial humiliation.

That's all I'm saying. The next paragraph is just a marvel of the English language. I have lived in LA for two years, but now I am back and want to move back to LA.  Where do you live, Bro?

It goes with our unzipped pants. And our unbuckled belt, and combined with your uncombed hair you can look unemployed. And be unwelcome in restaurants. That's unbelievable. This shirt is actually a 2XL. That's right, I did it. Mission accomplished. There should be a moving up ceremony for when you hit 2XL. It is with great pride and slight disgust, that we present this garment roughly the size of a circus tent, to this slob who actually struggles to put on his own socks. He may now burp for no reason at all. I am new to the 2XL community. They've been very welcoming. I did some research. You know what the size after 2XL is? Kill yourself. No, it's 3X! Triple X! That's pornographic. It's so fat it's obscene. Triple X does sound like some fat on fat action. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And I'm headin' there, hopefully by the end of the show. I don't know what happened. All I did was eat abusively for 40 years. And suddenly I'm fat? That doesn't seem fair.

Well, I had my appendix removed. But it still counts. I didn't know what the appendix was, and since I'm an idiot I just pretended like I did. The doctor was like, ""We have to remove your appendix,"" and I was, like, ""Both of them?"" Luckily he thought I was kidding. He was, like... (imitates laughing) Ah! I'm so grateful he didn't call me out. I don't know what I would've said, you know? Like, ""There's only one appendix."" ""Oh, ha ha, appendix. I– I thought you said lungs. To me they sound similar 'cause I'm dumb."" I didn't know what the appendix was, but I don't feel that bad. The doctor told me science isn't even sure what the appendix does exactly. Science isn't even sure why the appendix exists. And I heard that and I was, like, oh my gosh, the appendix is like a Kardashian. It is. Think about it. It's a mystery to everyone. But for some of us, causes excruciating pain. It needs to be removed with a knife. Obviously, I'm not promoting violence, against any of the Kardashians. Just the mother.

See all these muscles? I thought I pulled one... doin' nothin'. And the pain was overwhelming. I couldn't move. My wife was like, ""I'm gonna go for help, I'm gonna go for help.""

So when he introduced himself I was like, am I being visited by the ghost of sandwich past? Is Nurse Po'Boy about to come in? I woke up after the surgery covered in Mardi Gras beads. No, I woke up and there was a nurse standing there and she was like, ""The surgery was a success. Just let me know if it hurts when you pee,"" and I was like wait, where's the appendix? How exactly did you remove it? This doesn't sound like a success at all. Then she explained, right before the surgery, they inserted a catheter. I didn't know what that was so I was like, ""Oh, okay."" And then I started piecing it together. It hurts when I pee, catheter. I'm suing this hospital! You'll be hearing from my lawyer-doctor.

My kids were havin' fun. I was pretending like I enjoyed being outside. And then suddenly we saw a bear, like, 500 yards away, this huge brown bear, like, way bigger then a gummy bear. And I was so excited 'cause I watch nature shows, but I had never seen a bear in person so it felt like a celebrity sighting. I was like, ""Oh my God, I've watched you on Animal Planet. ""You're so much taller in person. Can we do a selfie?"" But unlike a celebrity sighting, there was the risk of death. Like, you never hear, we're in restaurant, Tom Hanks walked in and then he came over and murdered my family. That never happens. But the bear was far away, so I took out my phone and I started taking pictures, and then suddenly the bear stood up, roared and looked right at me. Started creeping towards me, tilting his head back and forth almost like he recognized me. ""That guy looks like Phillip Seymour Hoffman."" (audience cheering, applauding) I was terrified. Luckily, we were with a tour guide, and I looked at him and he goes, ""Don't worry, I have bear spray,"" and I was like, ""Do you have anything stronger? ""Like a bear gun?

Walk backwards slowly."" I guess, so the bear could catch up. So we started walking backwards slowly. By then the bear was in a full sprint. I had surgery 12 hours ago, so I smelled delicious. I was also sunburned, so I probably looked like a giant land salmon. The bear couldn't believe his luck, like, ""I'm not gonna have to eat for a month."" I was like, ""I'm gonna die! I'm gonna be eaten by a bear!"" Which is ironic given how many animals I've eaten. So I started humming ""Circle of Life,"" and continued walking backwards slowly. I should point out it's not like we were walking backwards slowly to a car or a cabin. We were walking backwards slowly to nothing. It probably looked like we were teasing the bear like, ""Come and get it, Mr. Bear. ""Are you looking to get a little grisly? Craving a little 2XL are you?"" And before you knew it the bear was upon us, and he killed us and we died. Such a bloody mess. No, what really happened, is at one point the tour guide pulled out this thing, it looked like a pen. I was like, ""Great, he's gonna ask for the bears autograph."" And I learned later on it was a bear flare, and he squeezed it, and this tiny fire ball went out towards the bear and I was like, ""Oh good, something to anger the bear."" The fireball bounced off the bear. The bear stopped and then just ran the other way like it forgot something at home. And we all looked at each other like, ""Oh my gosh, that just happened, that just happened."" And that's a true story. Well, most of that's true. Well, it's all true except there was no bear.

It's like he's tryin' to get caught."" If anything, this guy's plan was foolproof. What he did on his anniversary is he threw a party for him and his wife, and they invited all their friends so that they could see how happy they were, and then the next morning he took his wife fishing. He rented a boat, he brought a cooler, some tackle, three concrete blocks and a tarp.You know, for fishing. And he woulda gotten away with the whole thing, but three months after his wife disappeared at sea, he got engaged to a stripper. Which is kinda suspicious. And to celebrate their engagement, they dropped acid, as tradition would have. And while tripping on acid, he admitted the whole thing to his fiance.

So, I just go, ""Relax, I'm gonna be nice tonight. I've changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously."" And I go, ""Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course."" And what a year she's had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn't do a lot for women drivers..."" That's a clever joke. I'll tell you why. Right? It's layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I'm playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she's a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she's a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let's not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That's... the target of the joke, just so we're clear. Okay?"

A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off... and a hole gouged out, into– I'm not a doctor! But that is... the gist of it. I know which one I'd rather have done. I'm not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can't see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal... to a chimp. So...

We're literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We're closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is... our parents mate... we're born... we grow... we mate... our parents die... our friends die... and then we die. Now... my seven-year-old niece didn't like hearing that. But I said, ""You've gotta learn. Stop crying."" I said, ""You're seven. You know... today. So... Any more grizzling and this party's cancelled, so..."" Let's take the first of those. Birth. It's odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That's why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That's why we're so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, ""I'm proper pregnant."" Right? I'm gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, ""Mum!"" It's got to be fucking ready. We're... we're helpless, right? Just think, nine months we're growing in this perfect environment. Everything's... It's like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you're being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You're covered in shit, there's screaming. You go, ""I can't breathe.""

Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It's a rarefied place. It's like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don't know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn't get mugged or molested. There weren't many pedophiles in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There's no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street.

I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, ""He's an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary... scum."" And I say..

And she does a blog, and they're talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, ""Dear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy."" Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right?

A joke about a bad thing isn't as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said... ""You should never make jokes about food allergies."" I should have left it, right? I sent back, ""I make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you're telling me I should never joke about food allergies?"" She sent back, ""Yes, but the Holocaust didn't kill children."" Well... it did, didn't it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. ""Didn't kill children..."" Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn't make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy... evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But... if I was throwing a dinner party, and I'd been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to... either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies... I know who'd ruin that party more. Everyone's enjoying it. ""Everything okay?"" ""Ja, ist yummy!"" Right? He's loving it. I go, ""Cheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?""

It falls into two tribes. ""I don't agree with them, so I block them."" And now, in this post-truth era, people don't care about the argument, they say, ""Who's saying the argument? No, they're not on our side."" It's ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we've always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it's my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, ""I believe the Earth is 6,000 years old."" ""I believe you're a fucking idiot.""

I should say one thing in Twitter's defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I'm very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco's or something. That's the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I've been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we've got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who've retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one's gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I'll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, ""Ban bullfighting."" Someone always says, ""What about the kids in Syria?"" What?

No. Tai Chi is just exercise for people who are too old to exercise. Let's not exoticize these things, you know? It's actually super simple to do Tai Chi.

Because you get, like, these like, entry-level-job-having people in Texas. And they're like, Joanna, we're looking for a six bedroom house on three acres of land and our budget's $50,000. Bitch, I can't even buy a crack house in Compton for $50,000. HGTV is just basically ""MTV Cribs"" for adults. Because when you were 15, you had crazier dreams, you know? You watch ""MTV Cribs,"" and you're like, oh, man, one day, I hope I can have a Lamborghini. One day, I hope I can have a fridge with only Gatorades. And now, you're like 35, your dreams just get a little more realistic. You're watching HGTV, and you're just, like, oh, man, one day, I wish I could just fix this roof. Look, I'm doing, like, fine by any measure, you know? But I still live in a one-bedroom apartment because that shit is rent-controlled. And when the Asian people, when we find a good deal, we're never letting that shit go. -Yeah. That apartment is about to be generational. It's gonna get passed to my nephew, his kids, and all that. It's mine now, basically. I don't want to buy a house. I live by myself, and I'm scared of ghosts. I've seen enough movies to know that ghosts only haunt houses, not one bedroom apartments."

I've seen enough Hollywood movies to know that ghost only haunt rich people's houses in the suburbs, preferably with a newborn baby, because they got way too much to lose. Shit is high stakes. I live by myself. I ain't got nothing to lose. A ghost come haunt me, I just move. Worse comes to worse, I lose my security deposit. Fuck it, you know? What's a ghost gonna do? He's gonna follow me from unit to unit, start knocking on my light fixtures and shit. I'm like, hey, dog, go ahead. It's not even mine. You fuck around, we both get evicted, OK? Like, you don't want to be a homeless ghost. And if you really think about it, what kind of loser ghost haunts an apartment? That means that ghost probably died in an apartment. He didn't even die a homeowner. I ain't got no respect for that shit. He comes haunt me, I just start talking shit to him. Like, hey, dog, what was your credit score when you died, though, like, for real? For real."

I'm not gonna say, like, they're racist or anything like that, but they're just, like, curious. Like they're watching me like they're watching an episode of National Geographic. And a pack of giraffes just ran by, and they're like, oh, I've never seen one of those in real life. It looks majestic. This one kid in Kansas City came up to me after the show, very nice kid. This is what he said. He was like, ah, Jimmy, thought you were really funny, man. I don't mean to offend you– that's when you know you're about to get offended. He was like, I don't mean to offend you, but when I first saw your poster, I thought you were gonna play the violin. I was like, I do, motherfucker, just not right now. Shit."

And I was like, thanks, ma'am, fifth chair, actually, fifth chair. I wasn't– I wasn't very good. I wasn't good. "

And now I'm telling dick jokes and doing Tai Chi on stage, so– Jimmy was just kind of like an arbitrary English name that just sounded easy. And my dad, he named himself Richard. I was like, Dad, why'd you name yourself Richard? He was like, because I want to be rich. It makes so much sense."

That was a serious national sport back home, man. You know, I didn't go to any, like, fun summer camp, space camp. My dad sent me to a ping pong training camp in Gwangju, China. I almost died. It was 100 kids competing for one spot on the national team. It was basically Fortnite with ping pong paddles."

Not because of some weird genetic thing, just because our parents cared so much more about mathematics and academics. You guys seen it. You guys seen those, like, Kumon Learning Centers in those strip malls, right, right? Kumon Learning Centers, for you guys that don't know, are basically detention camps for young Asian children. You can tell that place is kind of fucked up by the look of its logo. Because it's supposed to be a smiley face, but it's not really smiling. It's just like, meh."

They never let me use a calculator until I turned 15, so I can work on my brain function. That's an old school Chinese strategy. So when I turned 15, it was a very special occasion. It was basically my Quinceañera. My dad just gave me a TI-83 Plus."

So when I was 14 years old, I stole my brother's calculator. I stole Roy Rogers calculator, and I locked myself in my room. And I started rebelling. I started doing math homework. Other kids were, like, fucking around with, like, alcohol and drugs. I was fucking up some parabolas, you know? Locked myself in a room, I was just punching in numbers. I was like, oh, man, this feels great, you know? It's so wrong. It's awesome."

And he was screaming. He was like, (CHINESE ACCENT) Jimmy! Jimmy! What are you doing inside? Come out right now. I know you're in there using a calculator. Come out right now. I was so scared I didn't know what to do. And he unlocked the door, and he came in. I went into full panic mode. So I just threw away the calculator, and I pulled down my pants. I was like, Dad, I was just jerking off. And he came in, and he looked at me. And then he looked at the math homework. And he was like good, good, very good. Very good, very good, you must really like math. That's good. Keep it up.

It didn't become a stereotype until I came to this country when I was 13 years old. And I automatically became the weird foreign kid. Like, I didn't really even know how to speak English. I learned English how you guys will learn Spanish, just on paper. But if I would have dropped you off in Mexico when you're 13 years old, you would've died."

First day of school, this girl came up to me. She was like, hey, what's up? I didn't know what that meant, so I just looked up.'"

Like the first day of PE class, first day of PE class, we had to change into our gym clothes. I'd never done that. Everybody was wearing boxers, and I was still wearing tighty-whiteys. And this kid, this bully next to me, he was being real mean. He was like, hey, look, the Asian kid's wearing tighty-whiteys. That's gay. And I was like, oh, really, is I what it means? I had no idea. And then I put on my gym shorts, but my mom had bought me gym shorts that was my exact size, an extra small. So that wasn't very cool, because it came down mid-thigh. And apparently back in the day, that was called a John Stockton. And the same kid next to me, that bully next to me, he was like, hey, hey, look at– don't wear your pants like that."

Everybody was looking at me, and this kid kept saying pull your pants down. So I was like, oh, shit. I've seen Shawshank Redemption. Maybe this is just how it works in America. So I start pulling down my shorts all the way down to my knees, all the way down to my ankle. And that same kid, the bully next to me, is like, hey, what are you doing? Don't pull them down all the way. That's gay. And I'm like, what is not gay in this country? And apparently this other kid next me, he's like, hey, don't pull them down all the way. Just sag them a little bit. Just sag your pants. And I didn't know what sagging your pants meant. Apparently, that's a cool, hip hop thing, to pull your pants down halfway down your butt so you show everybody you asshole.

Eventually, I learned how to speak English by watching a lot of TV, mainly BET Rap City. Because that was my shit. I want to be cool, and nothing cooler than BET Rap City, right? Every music video was a slice of somebody's American dream. The first music video I saw was Jay-Z's ""Big Pimpin'"". You guys remember that shit? Jay-Z's ""Big Pimpin'"" was the greatest music video of all time. It was Jay-Z and his boys on a yacht pouring champagne on this beautiful woman's face for, like, four minutes.

I want to be like Jay-z in ""Big Pimpin'"". So I started my own rap group in high school. This is a true story. It was me, my black friend Julian, and my other friend Yugi, who was half black and half Japanese. So we are perfectly 1 and 1/2 black dudes and 1 and 1/2 Asian dudes. And we called ourselves The Yellow Panthers. I know. I wish I was making this shit up, but I'm not. The Yellow Panthers was a real rap group. And we had a real rap song. It was called, ""Underground Railroad Builder."""

So I went up to my dad, I was like, dad, I don't want to do any of this. I want to go try and do stand-up. He was like, what's a– what's a stand-up? You mean like a talk show? I was like, yeah, sure, talk show, whatever you want to call it. But I want to go pursue my dreams. And he was like, no. Pursue your dreams how you become homeless. I was like, no, no, Dad, Dad, it's– things are different now. We're in America, OK? In America, we're supposed to do what we love. He was like, no.

What's that? And I'm like, Dad, he's bragging about his car. It's a Lamborghini Mercier Largo, a very expensive car. You know what that is, right? And he was like, oh, OK, OK, yes, yes.

I'm like, Dad, fine, if you think my life's so easy, why don't you go to some open call auditions and you'll understand how hard it is, how much rejection I face every day at my job. He was like, OK. And he went to all these auditions, and he started booking everything. It's a true story. He got on this show in China, in mainland China, called ""Little Daddy,"" ""Xiao Baba.""

Oh, that's very good, you and your son, same busyness, you know? You two are very funny. He's like, no, no, Jimmy is not funny. I'm like, Dad that's bullshit, OK? You got one good role, good for you. I'm happy for you. But you're not a real actor yet. Real actors, we got to cry, we got to laugh. Do you even know how to cry in front of a camera?

I brought– one time, I brought a full price shirt home, $20. And she was like, was it full price? No, it's a bad deal. I was like, Mom, it's only 20 bucks. She's like, yes, $20, if you're stupid. She goes to Ross and she freaks out, because everything's a great deal. She's like, Jimmy, you should buy this. You should buy– this is a good deal. This is a good deal. I'm like Mom, that's a double XL shirt, OK? And it says Obey on it. I'm not gonna fucking wear that. And she's like, it's OK, 50% off. Some day it'll fit, OK?"

There's a piece of fish still flopping around on the floor. Half the place place is an aquarium.

This regular stuff you eat, they have growth hormones in them. It's gonna fucking kill you. I'm like, really, growth hormones? Wait a minute. You're trying to tell me I've been eating growth hormones all my life, and I'm still 5′ 5″ and I shop at Gap Kids? Get the fuck out of here. I'll pay extra for growth hormones.

Hand soap used to be that piece of crap leftover soap that my dad's been washing his balls with for two months. And he just puts it on the soap counter. You walk by, you rub your two fingers on it for good luck. That was– that was hand soap. Nobody got sick. It was fine. Once in a while, you got a piece of pubes. So what? You deal with it."

You go to your friend's house, he's got that green bar soap that says Zest on it. That guy's a fucking peasant. Don't associate yourself with that kind of animal. He's gonna ask you for money, you know what I mean? And then next level up, you got like the $2 bottle of Softsoap with the fish or the watermelon on it, you know? I like that family.

Because as an American society, we decided we're way too good to rub our own two hands together to create our own foam, and rather outsource that foaming action to some poor Chinese kid in Gwangju, China to pre-foam it for us.

I know I make fun of my parents, but at the end of they day, I love them very much. I think we all do, right? But Asian people, we don't ever say I love you to each other. That's just not our thing. One time, I got high and I called my mom. I was like, Mom, I just– I just want to tell you, Mom, I love you. And you can hear her start, like, crying on the other side of the line.

I just haven't talked to him in three weeks. I'm like, you do understand, if I don't call my dad back in three hours, he's going to call 911. 911, what's your emergency? My son is dead!

It's easier to get into Mexico than a Costco. You just walk in. And that's it. But coming back was a totally different story. Coming back from Mexico to the US, there's no more revolving doors. "

I eat that hair. I love it so much. I make a pillow, I sleep on it. I love it. He's ugly, I'm into it."" You will never hear a guy be honest about his girlfriend being ugly. ‘Cause he doesn't see it.

I have been there when a zombie horde comes over the ridge, fucking kicks in a window and makes their nests, like in my show. I've been there... when they come in, one's missing a fucking femur.

A well-led bachelorette party understands you must send your troops in in waves so as to exhaust the bar... and deplete it of its resources. If you are at a bar and you see a bunch of girls come running in, do not be foolish. That is not the bride. That is not even the family. That is her infantry. These are her bannermen. They come running in first to let the bar know like... ""Stacy's getting married!"" They kick some girls out of a booth. ""This is our territory now. Get out of here!"" They set a waitress on fire.

And they both just had their legs open ’cause they don’t give a fuck, both legs just splayed. And then just this — just smooth. You know, just very… And I saw it. Didn’t give me a — didn’t do anything to me, but I kind of wanted to stop and go, ""Hey, fellows, let’s — let’s close that shit up, huh? You’re not getting me, but I know you’re causing a problem for somebody in this airport. Let’s close it up."" I did not say that… Otherwise I wouldn’t be here."

So Shaun Cassidy: Shaun Cassidy was a teen singer who then grew up — he was about 18 — he was, you know, old and gross. nobody wanted to fuck him. So he started to act, and he had a movie on TV called ""Normal People,"" where he played a retarded man who wants to live a normal life — it was very inspiring, actually. And at one point he goes to — he didn’t do, like, a big retarded character. He wore thick glasses, he talked like Elmer Fudd. That was the whole thing. So he goes up to the guy who runs the group home he lives in and he says, ""I want to get a job."" And the guys who runs it is like, you know, Republican, conservative."

So they let him get a job as an air traffic controller or whatever was available. And then… He meets a woman who’s also retarded, who lives at the group home. He falls in love with her. It’s a very nice love story. And he says, ""We want to get married."" And the guy says, ""Brr!"" She says, ""But they’re in love!"" So they get married. And then one day he says, ""We want to have a baby."" And the liberal lady says, ""No fucking way."" And they just shut them down right there. And that’s the end of the movie.

Now, we don’t say the word and I don’t see ’em anywhere. I guess that’s my problem with it. And also, the word is not basically a bad word. It’s a medical term, but it became a bad word because it’s used as an insult, really — not towards retarded people. Nobody does that. Nobody calls retarded people retarded to insult them.

Did we go back to them and explain this to them? ""Listen, Nelson, I have somethin’ to tell you, you’re not retarded anymore."" ""You mean I’m cured?"" ""No! No, no.

This is important to me. You ever look at your mom and go, like, ""Mom, how many dicks? Just how many?"" I lost my mom. So those are the things I don’t know. So I’m curious. I don’t feel like a lot of dudes fucked my mom. Not ’cause she’s, like, pure, because, like, I don’t think so. But I hope it was as many as she wanted. That’s what I hope — I hope she got all the dicks she ever dreamed of because I loved her. I hope at the end, my mom was like, ""That with plenty of dicks. Whew-hoo!"" But I’ll never know — because you don’t know your mom. That’s the truth — you don’t really know your mother. You feel like you know her, but you know what she told you. She didn’t tell you shit. You don’t tell your kids your life. What did your mother tell you? ""I won a swimming medal when I was 12."" She didn’t tell you, like, ""I used to fuck this guy at work, it was amazing."" She didn’t tell you that. Think about your mom’s life story as she told it to you. There’s huge holes in that story. ""Well, I graduated when I was 22 and then I met your father when I was 35."" ""Feels like a lot of dicks would fit right in there, Mom."""
2020,Sincerely,Louis CK,Washington D.C.,M,8.4,9,4257,8.1,8.4,203,2984,62,"You know those movies where you’re — where a mother and a daughter switch bodies. You ever seen a movie like — it’s always like, ""Freaky Friday,"" some Disney comedy where a mother and a daughter switch bodies and then they’re like, ""Whoa!"" Then they have to water ski and be in a rock band together. And then they switch back and they know each other better. That’s the formula I think they should make it another one of those movies. But it should be about a mother who switches bodies with her son. But it’s not a comedy, it’s a drama — like a medical affliction. They’re upset the whole time. She’s in the bathroom in the morning, ""I’m holding my son’s penis. It’s confusing."" And her son is in her body, he’s like, ""I don’t want to be my mommy anymore. I don’t like how it feels."" And his dad comes home and he starts fucking ‘im. ""Oh, God! What’s happening now? I don’t like this, but I don’t want to say no to my dad."" And then at the end of the movie, they never switch back."
